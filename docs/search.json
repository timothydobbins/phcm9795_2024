    "section": "1.1 An introduction to statistics",
    "text": "1.1 An introduction to statistics\nThe dictionary of statistics (Upton and Cook, 2008) defines statistics simply as: “The science of collecting, displaying, and analysing data.”\nStatistics is a branch of mathematics, together with theoretical/pure mathematics and applied mathematics. Within the field of statistics, there are two main divisions: mathematical statistics and applied statistics. Mathematical statistics deals with development of new methods of statistical inference and requires detailed knowledge of abstract mathematics for its implementation. Applied statistics applies the methods of mathematical statistics to specific subject areas, such as business, psychology, medicine and sociology.\nBiostatistics can be considered as the “application of statistical techniques to the medical and health fields”. However, biostatistics sometimes overlaps with mathematical statistics. For instance, given a certain biostatistical problem, if the standard methods do not apply then existing methods must be modified to develop a new method.\n\n1.1.1 Scope of Biostatistics\nResearch is essential in the practice of health care. Biostatistical knowledge helps health professionals in deciding whether to prescribe a new drug for the treatment of a disease or to advise a patient to give up drinking alcohol. To practice evidence-based healthcare, health professionals must keep abreast of the latest research, which requires understanding how the studies were designed, how data were collected and analysed, and how the results were interpreted. In clinical medicine, biostatistical methods are used to determine the accuracy of a measurement, the efficacy of a drug in treating a disease, in comparing different measurement techniques, assessing diagnostic tests, determining normal values, estimating prognosis and monitoring patients. Public health professionals are concerned about the administration of medical services or ensuring that an intervention program reduces exposure to certain risk factors for disease such as life-style factors (e.g. smoking, obesity) or environmental contaminants. Knowledge of biostatistics helps determine them make decisions by understanding, from research findings, whether the prevalence of a disease is increasing or whether there is a causal association between an environmental factor and a disease.\nThe value of biostatistics is to transform (sometimes vast amounts of) data into meaningful information, that can be used to solve problems, and then be translated into practice (i.e. to inform public health policy and decision making). When undertaking research having a biostatistician as part of a multidisciplinary team from the outset, together with scientists, clinicians, epidemiologists, healthcare specialists is vital, to ensure the validity of the research being undertaken and that information is interpreted appropriately."

    "section": "1.2 Descriptive and inferential statistics",
    "text": "1.2 Descriptive and inferential statistics\nTo understand the concepts of statistics, it is important to realise there are two ways of using data: one is via descriptive statistics and the other is via inferential statistics.\n\n1.2.1 Descriptive statistics\nDescriptive statistics provide a ‘picture’ of the characteristics of a population. Examples of descriptive statistics based on the population are given below.\n\n1.2.1.1 Births\nThese examples on descriptive statistics consider all the births in Australia in 2019 (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2021)). The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare produce comprehensive reports annually on the characteristics of Australia’s mothers and babies of the most recent year of data from the National Perinatal Data Collection.\nOne headline from the report is “Nearly two thirds of mothers were aged between 25 and 34 years (185,958 women in 2019)”, which is accompanied by a figure illustrating the age distribution of mothers in Australia giving birth in 2019. This example shows descriptive statistics that are presented as the actual number of women giving birth in 2019, together with a comparison of age distributions across Australian states.\nFurther descriptive statistics provide summary information, about the average (mean) age of women giving birth in 2019 (30.8 years) and the proportion of mothers who were Indigenous (4.8%).\n\n\n1.2.1.2 Deaths\nIn another example, consider characteristics of all the deaths in Australia in 2020 (Australian Bureau of Statistics (2021)).\n\n“During the pandemic many countries saw a change in mortality patterns, including COVID-19 becoming a leading cause of death.”\n\nThe report presents the leading causes of death in 2020, comparing the age-standardised rates between 2019 and 2020:\n\n“The top five leading causes of death remained the same as in 2019 (Ischaemic heart disease, Dementia including Alzheimer’s disease, Cerebrovascular diseases, Lung cancer and Chronic lower respiratory diseases).\nThe age-standardised death rate decreased for all top five leading causes of death from 2019.\nDeaths due to chronic lower respiratory diseases (including emphysema) had the highest proportional rate decrease from 2019 at 17.8%.\nThe reduction in acute respiratory conditions such as pneumonia contributed to a decrease in the top five leading causes of death.\nAll top five leading causes of death are non-communicable diseases (they are not passed from person to person).”\n\nThe information was also presented as a visualisation / infographic, demonstrating a simplistic, yet valuable way of presenting data and enabling rates of death for 2019 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Age-standardised death rates for the top five leading causes, 2019-2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Inferential statistics\nInferential statistics use data collected from a sample of the population, to make conclusions (inferences) about the whole population (that the sample was drawn from).\nThe following example is about a sample of prisoners, from the National Prisoner Health Data Collection (NPHDC). The NPHDC is the main source of national data about the health of prisoners in Australia. It gathers information over a 2-week period from prison entrants, dischargees, prisoners visiting the prison health clinic, and prisoners taking prescribed medication.\nWe have information about the population of prisoners, given as the number of prisoners in Australia’s prisons from the ABS website:\n\nAt 30 June 2015: There were 36,134 prisoners in Australian prisons, an increase of 7% (2,345 prisoners) from 30 June 2014.\n\nCharacteristics (sex, age group and Indigenous status) of the sample of prisoners from the NPHDC are given in the following table. We can use this information to make inferences about the whole population of prisoners that the sample was drawn from.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Characteristics of the sample of prisoners from the NPHDC"

    "section": "1.3 What are data?",
    "text": "1.3 What are data?\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, “data are measurements or observations that are collected as a source of information”.1 Note that technically, the word data is a plural noun. This may sound a little odd, but it means that we say “data are …” when discussing a set of measurements.\nOther definitions that we use in this course are:\n\nobservation, (or record, or unit record): one individual in the population being studied\nvariable: a characteristic of an individual being measured. For example, height, weight, eye colour, income, country of birth are all types of variables.\ndataset: the complete collection of all observations\n\n\n1.3.1 Types of varaibles\nWe can categorise variables into two main types: numeric or categorical.\nNumerical variables (also called quantitative variables) comprise data that must be represented by a number, which can be either measured or counted.\nContinuous variables can take any value within a defined range.\nFor example, age, height, weight or blood pressure, are continuous variables because we can make any divisions we want on them, and they can be measured as small as the instrument allows. As an illustration, if two people have the same blood pressure measured to the nearest millimetre of mercury, we may get a difference between them if the blood pressure is measured to the nearest tenth of millimetre. If they are still the same (to the nearest tenth of a millimetre), we can measure them with even finer gradations until we can see a difference.\nDiscrete variables can only take one of a distinct set of values (usually whole numbers). For discrete variables, observations are based on a quantity where both ordering and magnitude are important, such that numbers represent actual measurable quantities rather than mere labels.\nFor example, the number of cancer cases in a specified area emerging over a certain period, the number of motorbike accidents in Sydney, the number of times a woman has given birth, the number of beds in a hospital are all discrete variables. Notice that a natural ordering exists among the data points, that is, a hospital with 100 beds has more beds than a hospital with 75 beds. Moreover, a difference between 40 and 50 beds is the same as the difference between 80 and 90 beds.\nCategorical variables comprise data that describe a ‘quality’ or ‘characteristic’. Categorical variables, sometimes called qualitative variables, do not have measurable numeric values. Categorical variables can be nominal or ordinal.\nA nominal variable consists of unordered categories. For example, gender, race, ethnic group, religion, eye colour etc. Both the order and magnitude of a nominal variable are unimportant.\nIf a nominal variable takes on one of two distinct categories, such as black or white then it is called a binary or dichotomous variable. Other examples would be smoker or non-smoker; exposed to arsenic or not exposed.\nA nominal variable can also have more than two categories, such as blood group, with categories of: Group A, Group B, Group AB and Group O.\nOrdinal varaibles consist of ordered categories where differences between categories are important, such as socioeconomic status (low, medium, high) or student evaluation rating could be classified according to their level of satisfaction: (highly satisfied, satisfied and unsatisfied). Here a natural order exists among the categories.\nNote that categorical variables are often stored in data sets using numbers to represent categories. However, this is for convenience only, and these variable must not be analysed as if they were numeric variables."

    "section": "1.4 Presenting data",
    "text": "1.4 Presenting data\nWe will now look at ways to summarise and present data. The choice of presentation will depend on the type of variable being summarised. We will use the dataset based on a study into primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) from the Introduction to Stata or Introduction to R exercise to demonstrate the appropriate ways to summarise and present data.\n\n1.4.1 Summarising a single categorical variable numerically\nCategorical data are best summarised using a frequency table, where each category is summarised by its frequency: the count of the number of individuals in each category. The relative frequency (the frequency expressed as a proportion or percentage of the total frequency) is usually included give further insight.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1:  Sex of participants in PBC study \n\nSexFrequencyRelative frequency (%)\n\nMale4410.5\n\nFemale37489.5\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is sometimes useful to present the cumulative relative frequency, which shows the relative frequency of individuals in a certain category or below (for example, Table 1.2).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2:  Stage of disease for participants in PBC study \n\nStage *FrequencyRelative frequency (%)Cumulative relative frequency (%)\n\n1215.15.1\n\n29222.327.4\n\n315537.665.0\n\n414435.0100.0\n\n* Disease stage was missing for 6 participants\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 1.2, we can see that 65.0% of participants had Stage 3 disease or lower.\n\n\n1.4.2 Summarising a single categorical variable graphically\nA categorical variable is best summarised graphically using a bar chart. For example, we can present the distribution of Stage of Disease graphically using a bar graph (Figure 1.3). Bar graphs, which are suitable for plotting discrete or categorical variables, are defined by the fact that the bars do not touch.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Bar graph of stage of disease from PBC study\n\n\n\n\nPie charts can be an alternative way to summarise a categorical variable graphically, however their use is not recommended for the following reasons:\n\nNot ideal when there are many categories to compare\nThe use of percentages is not appropriate when the sample size is small\nCan be misleading by using different size pies, different rotations and different colours to draw attention to specific groups\n3D and exploding bar charts further distort the effect of perspective and may confuse the reader\n\nPie charts will not be discussed further in this course.\n\n\n1.4.3 Summarising a single continuous variable numerically\nWhen summarising continuous data numerically, there are two things we want to know:\n\nWhat is the average value? And,\nHow variable (or spread out) are the data?\n\nWe will use a sample of 35 ages (in whole years) to illustrate how to calculate the average value and measures of variability:\n59 41 44 43 31 47 53 59 35 60 54 61 67 52 43 46 39 69 50 64 57 39 54 50 51 31 48 49 70 44 60 51 37 53 34\n\n1.4.3.1 Measures of central tendency\n\n\n1.4.3.2 Mean\nThe most commonly used measure of the central tendency of the data is the mean, calculated as:\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x}{n}\\]\nFrom the age example: \\(\\bar{x}\\) = 1745/35 = 49.9. Thus, the mean age of this sample is 49.9 years.\n\n\n1.4.3.3 Median\nOther measures of central tendency include the median and mode. The median is the middle value of the data, the value at which half of the measurements lie above it and half of the measurements lie below it.\nTo estimate the median, the data are ordered from the lowest to highest values, and the middle value is used. If the middle value is between two data points (if there are an even number of observations), the median is an average of the two values.\nUsing our example, we could rank the ages from smallest to largest, and locate the middle value (which has been bolded):\n31 31 34 35 37 39 39 41 43 43 44 44 46 47 48 49 50 50 51 51 52 53 53 54 54 57 59 59 60 60 61 64 67 69 70\nHere, the median is estimated as 50 years.\nNote that, in practice, the median is usually calculated by software automatically, and there is no need to rank our data.\n\n\n1.4.3.4 Describing the spread of the data\nIn addition to measuring the centre of the data, we also need an estimate of the variability, or spread, of the data points.\n\n\n1.4.3.5 Range\nThe absolute measure of the spread of the data is the range, that is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset.\nRange = highest data value – lowest data value\nUsing the age example, Range = 70 - 31 = 39 years.\nThe range is most usefully reported as the actual lowest and highest values e.g. Range: 31 to 70 years.\nThe range is not always ideal as it only describes the extreme values, without considering how the bulk of the data is distributed between them.\n\n\n1.4.3.6 Variance and standard deviation\nMore useful statistics to describe the spread of the data around a mean value are the variance and standard deviation. These measures of variability depend on the difference between individual observations and the mean value (deviations). If all values are equal to the mean there would be no variability at all, all deviations would be zero; conversely large deviations indicate greater variability.\nOne way of combining deviations in a single measure is to first square the deviations and then average the squares. Squaring is done because we are equally interested in negative deviations and positive deviations; if we averaged without squaring, negative and positive deviations would ‘cancel out’. This measure is called the variance of the set of observations. It is ‘the average squared deviation from the mean’. Because the variance is in ‘square’ units and not in the units of the measurement, a second measure is derived by taking the square root of the variance. This is the standard deviation (SD), and is the most commonly used measure of variability in practice, as it is a more intuitive interpretation since it is in the same units as the units of measurement.\nThe formula for the variance of a sample (\\(s^2\\)) is:\n\\[ s^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1} \\]\nNote that the deviations are first squared before they are summed to remove the negative values; once summed they are divided by the sample size minus 1.\nThe sample standard deviation is the square root of the of the sample variance:\n\\[s = \\sqrt{s^2}\\] For the age example, we would calculate the sample variance using statistical software. The sample standard deviation is estimated as: \\(s = 10.47 \\text{ years}\\).\nCharacteristics of the standard deviation:\n\nIt is affected by every measurement\nIt is in the same units as the measurements\nIt can be converted to measures of precision (standard error and 95% confidence intervals) (Module 3)\n\n\n\n1.4.3.7 Interquartile range\nThe inter-quartile range (IQR) describes the range of measurements in the central 50% of values lie. This is estimated by calculating the values that cut the data at the bottom 25% and top 25%. The IQR is the preferred measure of spread when the median has been used to describe central tendency.\nIn the age example, the IQR is estimated as 43 to 59 years. Note that R and Stata use slightly different methods to calculate the interquartile range (Stata IQR: 43 to 59 years; R IQR: 43 to 58 years). This difference is not practically important, and either range would be considered correct.\n\n\n1.4.3.8 Population values: mean, variance and standard deviation\nThe examples above show how the sample mean, range, variance and standard deviation are calculated from the sample of ages from 35 people. If we had information on the age of the entire population that the sample was drawn from, we could calculate all the summary statistics described above (for the sample) for the population.\nThe equation for calculating the population mean is the same as that of sample mean, though now we denote the population mean as \\(\\mu\\):\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{\\sum{x}}{N} \\]\nWhere \\(\\sum{x}\\) represents the sum of the values in the population, and \\(N\\) represents the total number of measurements in the population.\nTo calculate the population variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)) and standard deviation(\\(\\sigma\\)), we use a slightly modified version of the equation for \\(s^2\\):\n\\[ \\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x - \\mu)^2}{N} \\]\nwith a population standard deviation of: \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\\).\nIn practice, we rarely have the information for the entire population to be able to calculate the population mean and standard deviation. Theoretically, however, these statistics are important for two main purposes:\n\nthe characteristics of the normal distribution (the most important probability distribution discussed in later modules) are defined by the population mean and standard deviation;\nwhile calculating sample sizes (discussed in later modules) we need information about the population standard deviation, which is usually obtained from the existing literature.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Summarising a single continuous variable graphically\nAs well as calculating measures of central tendency and spread to describe the characteristics of the data, a graphical plot is very helpful to better understand the characteristics and distribution of the measurements obtained. Histograms and box plots are excellent ways to graphically display continuous data.\n\n1.4.4.1 Frequency histograms\nA histogram that plots the frequency of the grouped observations is called a frequency histogram. Some features of a frequency histogram:\n\nThe area under each rectangle is proportional to the frequency\nThe rectangles are drawn without gaps between them (unlike a bar graph)\nThe data are ‘binned’ into discrete intervals (of (usually of equal width)\n\nIf the rectangles are symmetrically distributed about the middle of the histogram, we say that the data are symmetric, and the mean and median will be approximately equal.\nIf the histogram has a longer tail to the right, then the data are said to be positively skewed (or skewed to the right), and the mean will be greater than the median.\nIf the histogram has an extended tail to the left, then the data are negatively skewed (or skewed to the left) and the mean will be smaller than the median.\n\nThe skewness of a distribution is defined by the location of the longer tail, not the location of the peak of the data.\n\nFigure 1.4 presents two histograms from the PBC data from the Introduction to Stata exercise: for age and serum bilirubin. We can see that the distribution for age is roughly symmetric, while the distribution for serum bilirubin is highly positively skewed (or skewed to the right).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Histogram of age (left) and serum bilirubin (right) from PBC study data\n\n\n\n\nA slight variation on the frequency histogram is the density histogram, which plots the density on the y-axis. The density is a technical term, which is similar to the relative frequency, but is scaled so that the sum of the area of the bars is equal to 1.\nBoth the frequency and density histograms are useful for understanding how the data is distributed across the range of values. Taller bars indicate regions where the data is more densely concentrated, while shorter bars represent areas with fewer data points.\n\n\n1.4.4.2 Boxplots\nAnother useful way to inspect the distribution of data is by using a box plot. In a box plot:\n\nthe line across the box shows the median value\nthe limits of the box show the 25-75% range (i.e. the inter-quartile range (IQR) where the middle 50% of the data lie)\nthe bars (or whiskers) indicate the most extreme values (highest and lowest) that fall within 1.5 times the interquartile range from each end of the box\n\nthe upper whisker is the highest value falling within 75th percentile plus 1.5 × IQR\nthe lower whisker is the lowest value falling within 25th percentile minus 1.5 × IQR\n\nany values in the dataset lying outside the whiskers are plotted individually.\n\nIf the data are symmetric, the line across the box (the median value) will be in the centre of the box, and the tails will be roughly equal.\nFigure 1.5 presents two boxplots from the PBC data: for age and serum bilirubin. We can see that the boxplot for age has roughly equal tails, and the median (the horizontal line) lies roughly in the middle of the interquartile range (the shaded box). It would be reasonable to assume that age follows a symmetric distribution from this plot. The boxplot for serum bilirubin shows a much longer upper tail, and a median much closer to the bottom of the shaded box than the middle. The boxplot also shows a number of points above the 75th percentile plus 1.5 × IQR. As the upper tail is longer than the lower tail, this distribution is positively skewed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Box plot of age (left) and serum bilirubin (right) from PBC study data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.5 Summarising two categorical variables numerically\nSo far, we have discussed one-way frequency tables, that is, tables that summarise one variable. We can summarise more than two categorical variables in a table – called a cross tabulation, or a two-way (summarising two variables) table.\nUsing our PBC data, we can summarise the two categorical variables: sex and stage of disease. The two-way table of frequencies is shown in Table 1.3.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.3:  Frequency of participants by sex and stage of disease* \n\nStage\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nTotal\n\n\nSex\n\nMale38161744\n\nFemale1884139127368\n\nTotal2192155144412\n\n*Stage of disease was missing for 6 participants\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add percentages to two-way tables as either column or row percents. Using Table 1.3 as an example, column percents represent the relative frequencies of sex within each stage (Table 1.4).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.4:  Frequency of participants by sex and stage of disease*, including\ncolumn percents \n\nStage\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nTotal\n\n\nSex\n\nMale3 (14%)8 (9%)16 (10%)17 (12%)44 (11%)\n\nFemale18 (86%)84 (91%)139 (90%)127 (88%)368 (89%)\n\nTotal21 (100%)92 (100%)155 (100%)144 (100%)412 (100%)\n\n*Stage of disease was missing for 6 participants\n\n\n\n\n\nConversely, row percents represent the relative frequencies of stage within each sex (Table 1.5).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.5:  Frequency of participants by sex and stage of disease*, including row\npercents \n\nStage\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nTotal\n\n\nSex\n\nMale3 (7%)8 (18%)16 (36%)17 (39%)44 (100%)\n\nFemale18 (5%)84 (23%)139 (38%)127 (35%)368 (100%)\n\nTotal21 (5%)92 (22%)155 (38%)144 (35%)412 (100%)\n\n*Stage of disease was missing for 6 participants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.5.1 Tables containing more than two variables\nIt is possible to construct multi-way tables that summarise more than two categorical variables in a single table. However, tables can become complex when more than two variables are incorporated, and you may need to present the information as two tables or incorporate additional rows and columns.\nIn Figure 1.2, characteristics of the sample of prisoners from the NPHDC were presented. This table contains information about sex, age group and Indigenous status from different groups of prisoners; prison entrants, discharges, and prisoners in custody. This type of condensed information is often found in reports and journal articles giving demographic information, by different groups considered in the study.\nWe might also consider a table containing further pieces of information. The table presented in Figure 1.6 (from the health of Australia’s prisoners 2015 report) compares prison entrants and the general community by three variables: age group, Indigenous status, and highest level of completed education.\nCan you see any issues with the presentation of this table?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Highest level of completed education in prison entrants and the general community\n\n\n\n\nSource: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2015. The health of Australia’s prisoners 2015. Cat. no. PHE 207. Canberra: AIHW.\nSome issues in this table:\n\nThe title of the table does not contain full information about the variables in the table;\nIt is unclear how the percentages were calculated (which groupings added to 100%);\nThe ages are not labelled as such, thus without reading the text in report it is unclear that these are age groupings.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.6 Summarising two categorical variables graphically\nInformation from more than one variable can be presented as clustered or multiple bar chart (bars side-by-side) (Figure 1.7). This type of graph is useful when examining changes in the categories separately, but also comparing the grouping variable between the main bar variable. Here we can see that Stage 3 and Stage 4 disease is the most common for both males and females, but there are many more females within each stage of disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Bar graph of stage of disease by sex from PBC study\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative bar graph is a stacked or composite bar graph, which retains the overall height for each category, but differentiates the bars by another variable (Figure 1.8).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Stacked bar graph of stage of disease by sex from PBC study\n\n\n\n\nFinally, a stacked relative bar chart (Figure 1.9) displays the proportion of grouping variable for each bar, where each overall bar represents 100%. These graphs allow the reader to compare the proportions between categories. We can easily see from Figure 1.9 that the distribution of sex is similar across each stage of disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Relative frequency of sex within stage of disease from PBC study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.7 Line graphs\nA line graph is effective to illustrate trends over time (e.g. change over several years). Let’s look at an example from cancer epidemiology.\nCancer incidence is the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a population in a given time period. A useful comparison with the incidence rate is the mortality rate, revealing information about the deaths from cancer in the same period. Figure 1.10 shows the prostate cancer trend in the NSW male population in the period 1972-2014, specifically the age-standardised incidence and mortality rate per 100,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: Prostate cancer age-standardised incidence and mortality rates (per 100,000), NSW, 1972-2014\n\n\n\n\nSource: The Cancer Institute NSW (2018) Cancer statistics NSW. https://www.cancer.nsw.gov.au/cancer-statistics-nsw (Accessed: 24 Jan 2019).\nThe age standardised incidence rate for prostate cancer increased steadily in the period 1972 – 1991, from 55.2 cases per 100,00 to 109.3 cases per 100,000. There were two notable peaks in incidence in the period 1972-2014. In particular, there was an increase between 1992-1994, and also between 2002-2009. Since 2009 (to 2014) the rates decreased from 198.9 per 100,000 to 148.2 per 100,000. Whilst the incidence rate for prostate cancer has fluctuated over the period, the age standardised mortality rate remained relatively stable (around 35 deaths per 100,000). Since 2009 the mortality rate appears to be decreasing and was at its lowest in 2014 at 22.1 per 100,000.\n[The increase in prostate cancer incidence in the early 1990’s occurred at a time when blood testing of men for Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) became more widespread. The more recent peak in incidence in the early 2000’s maybe explained by PSA being increasingly used as a screening test for men who did not have symptoms of prostate cancer.]"

    "text": "1.5 Presentation guidelines\n\n1.5.1 Guidelines for presenting summary statistics\nWhen reporting summary statistics, it is important not to present results with too many decimal places. Doing so implies that your data have a higher level of precision than they do. For example, presenting a mean blood pressure of 100.2487 mmHg implies that blood pressure can be measured accurately to at least three decimal places.\nThere are a number of guidelines that have been written to help in the presentation of numerical data. Many of these guidelines are based on the number of decimal places, while others are based on the number of significant figures. Briefly, the number of significant figures are “the number of digits from the first non-zero digit to the last meaningful digit, irrespective of the position of the decimal point. Thus, 1.002, 10.02, 100200 (if this number is expressed to the nearest 100) all have four significant digits.” Armitage, Berry, and Matthews (2013)\nA summary of these guidelines that will be used in this course appear in Table 1.6.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.6:  Guidelines for presentation of statistical results \n\nSummary statisticGuideline (reference)\n\nMeanIt is usually appropriate to quote the mean to one extra decimal place compared with the raw data. (Altman)\n\nMedian, Interquartile range, RangeAs medians, interquartile ranges and ranges are based on individual data points, these values should be presented with the same precision as the original data.\n\nPercentagePercentages do not need to be given with more than one decimal place at most. When the sample size is less than 100, no decimal places should be given. (Altman)\n\nStandard deviationThe standard deviation should usually be given to the same accuracy as the mean, or with one extra decimal place. (Altman)\n\nStandard errorAs per standard deviation\n\nConfidence intervalUse the same rule as for the corresponding effect size (be it mean, percentage, mean difference, regression coefficient, correlation coefficient or risk ratio) (Cole)\n\nTest statisticTest statistics should not be presented with more than two decimal places.\n\nP-valueReport p values to a single significant figure unless the p value is close to 0.05 (say, 0.01 – 0.2), in which case, report two significant figures. Do not report `not significant` for p values of 0.05 or higher. Very low p values can be reported as p &lt; 0.001 or similar. A p value can indeed be 1, although some investigators prefer to report this as &gt;0.9. (Assel)\n\nDifference in meansAs for the estimated means\n\nDifference in proportionsAs for the estimated proportions\n\nOdds ratio / Relative riskHazard and odds ratios are normally reported to two decimal places, although this can be avoided for high odds ratios (Assel)\n\nCorrelation coefficientOne or two decimal places, or more when very close to ±1   (Cole)\n\nRegression coefficientUse one more significant figure than the underlying data   (adapted from Cole)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Table presentation guidelines\nConsider the following guidelines for the appropriate presentation of tables in scientific journals and reports (Woodward, 2013).\n\nEach table (and figure) should be self-explanatory, i.e. the reader should be able to understand it without reference to the text in the body of the report.\n\nThis can be achieved by using complete, meaningful labels for the rows and columns and giving a complete, meaningful title.\nFootnotes can be used to enhance the explanation.\n\nUnits of the variables (and if needed, method of calculation or derivation) should be given and missing records should be noted (e.g. in a footnote).\nA table should be visually uncluttered.\n\nAvoid use of vertical lines.\nHorizontal lines should not be used in every single row, but they can be used to group parts of the table.\nSensible use of white space also helps enormously; use equal spacing except where large spaces are left to separate distinct parts of the table.\nDifferent typefaces (or fonts) may be used to provide discrimination, e.g. use of bold type and/or italics.\n\nThe rows and columns of each table should be arranged in a natural order to help interpretation. For instance, when rows are ordered by the size of the numbers they contain for a nominal variable, it is immediately obvious where relatively big and small contributions come from.\nTables should have a consistent appearance throughout the report so that the paper is easy to follow (and also for an aesthetic appearance). Conventions for labelling and ordering should be the same (for both tables as well as figures) for ease of comparison of different tables (and figures).\nConsider if there is a particular table orientation that makes a table easier to read.\n\nGiven the different possible formats of tables and their complexity, some further guidelines are given in the following excellent references:\n\nGraphics and statistics for cardiology: designing effective tables for presentation and publication, Boers (2018)\nGuidelines for Reporting of Figures and Tables for Clinical Research in Urology, Vickers et al. (2020)\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Graphical presentation guidelines\nConsider the following guidelines for the appropriate presentation of graphs in scientific journals and reports (Woodward, 2013).\n\nFigures should be self-explanatory and have consistent appearance through the report.\nA title should give complete information. Note that figure titles are usually placed below the figure, whereas for tables titles are given above the table.\nAxes should be labelled appropriately\nUnits of the variables should be given in the labelling of the axes. Use footnotes to indicate any calculation or derivation of variables and to indicate missing values\nIf the Y-axis has a natural origin, it should be included, or emphasised if it is not included.\nIf graphs are being compared, the Y-axis should be the same across the graphs to enable fair comparison\nColumns of bar charts should be separated by a space\nThree dimensional graphs should be avoided unless the third dimension adds additional information\n\nSources:\nAltman (1990)\nCole (2015)\nAssel et al.

    "text": "1.7 Part 1: A simple Stata analysis\nIn this very brief section, we will introduce Stata by calculating the average of six ages. If you are using Windows, open Stata by clicking: Start &gt; Stata 18 &gt; Stata SE\nIf you are using MacOS, open Stata from the Applications folder. Note that while Stata is available for Windows and MacOS, most of the screenshots in these notes will be based on the Windows version.\nAlternatively, open Stata using UNSW’s myAccess service.\nWhen you first open Stata, it will look something like the following.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Stata session has a number of windows, which we will discuss later. For now, look in the top row of icons and find the icons that look like two grids: one with a pencil, and one with a magnifying glass: . Click the left icon, the one with the pencil. The following window will appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis window is known as the Data Editor, and is where data can be entered or changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nEnter the following six ages into Stata, starting at the top-left cell, by typing each number and then hitting Enter:\n20 25  23  29  21  27\nIf you make a mistake, simply click the incorrect cell, and enter the correct value.\n\n\nYour screen should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two things to note here:\n\nData in Stata are entered down a column. In Stata, columns represent variables, and rows represent observations. So our six observations of age are entered in one column.\nStata has given the name of var1 to our column of ages. We will fix this in a moment.\n\nClose the Data Editor window to return to the main Stata window. You will notice that the main Stata window now has some text that you might not understand. We will explain why shortly.\nLet’s rename our variable from var1 to age. There are a few ways you can do this in Stata, but one of the most convenient is to use the Variables Manager which can be accessed via Data &gt; Variables Manager:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Variables Manager is where you can change many variable properties, such as variable names or apply meaningful variable labels. Each variable is listed on a separate row, with aspects about each variable listed in the columns. To change the variable name, click var1 in the Name column. Notice that information about that variable appears to the right of the window, in the Variable properties section.\nIn the Name section within Variable properties, click var1 and replace it with age. Click Apply and notice that the variable’s name has been changed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose the Variables manager window.\nSome important points about variable names in Stata:\n\nany name you choose must be no more than 32 characters long;\nvariable names must contain only letters, numbers and the underscore (_);\nvariable names should start with a letter;\nvariable names are case-sensitive (so age, Age and AGE could represent three different variables)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nRename the variable _var1 with the name age.\n\n\nNow that we have entered our six ages, let’s calculate the mean age. Choose Statistics &gt; Summaries, tables and tests &gt; Summary and descriptive statistics &gt; Summary statistics. The summarize dialog box will appear. From the Variables drop-down box, select age as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick OK, and the main Stata screen will appear as below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nCalculate summary statisitics for age and confirm: there are 6 observations, with a mean age of 24.2 years, a standard deviation of 3.49 years, a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 29 years.\n\n\n\n1.7.1 The Stata environment\nNow that we have seen a simple example of how to use Stata, let’s describe the Stata environment. The largest window in Stata is the Results window. This is where the results of your analyses appear, as well as any information, warnings or error messages. You may have noticed that the Results window also contains commands used to conduct analyses. For example, there is a command above summary output for age:\n. summarize age\nThis command is generated by Stata based on the entries in the summarize dialog box. Stata is inherently a command-driven program: the menus and dialog boxes simply generate commands that Stata interprets, and these commands (and their results) are included in the Results window. While most menu items and dialog boxes can be replicated using commands, it is easier to learn Stata using the menus and dialog boxes. In later Modules, we will include the commands that can be used as alternatives to using the Stata menus.\nThe Stata windows are summarised below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindow\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nResults\nShows your issued commands, results output (e.g. tables) and error messages or warnings.\n\n\nCommand\nWhere you can type in a command you want to run. The command window need not be used in this course\n\n\nVariables\nGives a list of the variables in your currently opened dataset.\n\n\nProperties\nShows the properties of your currently selected variable (selected from the Variables window) and of your currently opened dataset.\n\n\nHistory\nShows the history of your issued commands in your current session.\n\n\nData Editor (Edit)\nA separate window that allows you to edit or enter data.\n\n\nData Editor (Browse)\nA separate window that allows you to view data: data cannot be edited.\n\n\n\nStata allows you to perform most of your work by selecting options from the appropriate menus at the top of the main Stata window. A brief description of the main menu bar options follows.\nFile includes all the options you typically use in other programs, such as Open, Save, Exit. Note, that you can open or create various types of new files. The main type of file we open or create in this course is a Stata data file (.dta). In the Advanced Biostatistics and Statistical Computing course (PHCM9517), we will also use other file types such as a .do file for scripting (or writing) Stata commands.\nEdit includes the typical Copy, and Paste commands.\nData allows you to open the Data Editor. You can also create new variables and change current variables using Data &gt; Create or change data.\nGraphics includes the commands to create various types of graphs including box plots, histograms, scatterplots, line graphs, and bar charts.\nStatistics includes all the commands to carry out statistical analyses and perform power and sample size calculations. Much of this course will focus on using commands located in this menu.\nUser is for saved files from other windows (e.g. saved graphs). You will not need to use this option in this course.\nWindow can be used to select which window you want to view (e.g. Results, Data Editor).\nHelp has many useful options including the viewing the PDF documentation, a Search function and other resources for using Stata. We will also demonstrate how to use helpful resources later in this introductory manual. Another useful Stata resource is the video tutorials produced by Stata: https://www.stata.com/links/video-tutorials/"

The data come from a study in primary biliary cirrhosis, a condition of the liver, from Therneau and Grambsch (2010), Modeling Survival Data: Extending the Cox Model.

Here, we will open a dataset that has been stored as a Stata data file (which has the .dta suffix).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nLoad the sample data set called mod01_pbc.dta into Stata using the following steps:\n\nLocate the data set called mod01_pbc.dta on Moodle. Click the file to download it, and then save it in a folder you will be able to locate later - for example, your OneDrive folder. The description of this dataset (i.e. the metadata) have been saved as a plain text file: pbc_info.txt\nIn Stata, choose File &gt; Open. Browse to where you stored the dataset and click Open.\nYou may get an error: “Data in memory have changed”. This means that you have not saved a copy of your current data, and by importing a new dataset, your changes will be lost. As Stata can only open one set of data at a time, you can choose to: Save your current data, Don’t Save your current data, or Cancel. We don’t need to save the data from our simple analysis (the six ages), so we can choose Don’t Save.\n\nConfirm that there are 418 rows of data, and 20 variables.\nExamine the pbc_info.txt file for a description of each variable.\n\n\n\n\n1.8.2 Assigning variable labels\nAs we saw earlier, Stata has specific rules about variable names. Variable labels can be used to obtain more descriptive output. For example, the variable entered as bili can be labelled “Serum bilirubin (mg/dl)”.\nTo apply a variable label, open the Variables Manager: Data &gt; Variables Manager. Here we can click the variable to be labelled, and enter the new variable label and click Apply:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable label will now be used in place of the variable name in most output:\n\n. summarize bili, detail\n\n                   Serum bilirubin (mg/dl)\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n      Percentiles      Smallest\n 1%           .4             .3\n 5%           .5             .3\n10%           .6             .3       Obs                 418\n25%           .8             .4       Sum of Wgt.         418\n\n50%          1.4                      Mean           3.220813\n                        Largest       Std.

There are three continuous variables that we would like to summarise: age, AST and serum bilirubin. Each of these can be listed in the summarize dialog box, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the summarize command calculates the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. We may be interested in obtaining the median and interquartile ranges, so we select the Display additional statistics option:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary statistics are produced for each of the three variables. We will use describe the output for age:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output for a detailed summary in Stata should be read as three separate columns. The right-most column lists the number of observations, the mean and standard deviation and other numeric statistics. The left-most column contains the Percentiles: median (50%), lower quartile (25%) and upper quartile (75%). The middle column lists the four smallest and four largest observations, so that we can assess whether the smallest and largest observations are plausible.\nFor each of our three continuous variables, we need to decide whether to present the mean and standard deviation, or the median and interquartile range. This decision can be made after examining a histogram and boxplot for each variable.\n\n\n1.8.4 Producing a histogram\nTo produce a histogram, go to menu Graphics &gt; Histogram. Choose the variable to be plotted in the Variable box, and choose the Frequency radio button so that a frequency histogram is produced. Note that only one variable can be plotted at a time, so this procedure will need to be repeated for each continuous variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default histogram for age appears below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStata will automatically choose the number of bins and the width of each bin, however these decisions may not always produce the most optimal histogram. These options can be altered by defining either: the number of bins, or the bin width (but not both); and/or the lower limit of the first bin.\nLooking at the command window, Stata has used the following parameters to define the histogram: bin=20, start=26.277892, width=2.6080767. This means that Stata has chosen 20 bins to represent the data, with the first bin starting at 26.2 years and each bin representing 2.6 years. A more easily read histogram might have a bin-width of 5, starting at 25 years of age, so that age categories represent 25 to less than 30, 30 to less than 35 etc, as defined below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in a histogram with fewer bars and more sensible cut-points:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.8.5 Producing a boxplot\nThe boxplot dialog box is similar to the histogram dialog box. While it is possible to specify more than one variable to be plotted, this is not recommended when variables are measured on very different scales as all variables are plotted on a chart with the same scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nObtain histograms and boxplots for age, AST and bilirubin.\nBased on these plots, decide whether the mean or the median is the appropriate summary to use for each variable.\n\n\n\n\n1.8.6 Producing a one-way frequency table\nWe have three categorical variables to summarise in Table 1: sex, stage and vital status. These variables are best summarised using one-way frequency tables.\nChoose Statistics &gt; Summaries, tables, and tests &gt; Frequency tables &gt; One-way table. Choose the variable to be summarised as the Categorical variable, and leave all other options unchanged:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick OK to obtain the following table:\n\n        sex |      Freq.     Percent        Cum.\n------------+-----------------------------------\n          1 |         44       10.53       10.53\n          2 |        374       89.47      100.00\n------------+-----------------------------------\n      Total |        418      100.00\n\n\n\n1.8.7 Assigning value labels to categorical variables\nYou will notice that the table above, in its current form, is uninterpretable as the 1 and 2 categories are not labelled. In this course, all variables including categorical variables are numerically coded. This is because “string” or “character” variables (e.g. entered as “male” or “female”) cannot be used in many of the analysis commands of Stata. Instead, we use numerical codes and assign labels to the categories.\nThere are two parts to applying value labels to categorical variables: 1) defining the labels, and 2) applying the labels to a variable. This may seem cumbersome, but there are times where we can apply value labels to a collection of variables (for example, multiple variables comprising yes/no categories, or Likert scales such as: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree). Both parts can be done within the Variables Manager.\nPart 1: Defining the value labels\n\nOpen the Variables Manager: Data &gt; Variables Manager and select the variable you want to assign labels to (in this case, sex). You will see that the Value label in the Properties section is blank. To create a value label, click Manage.\n\nAlternatively, choose Data &gt; Data utilities &gt; Label utilities &gt; Manage value labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Manage value labels dialog box, click the Create label button.\n\nIn the next dialog box, enter a name for the value label such as sex_label in the Label name: box. You can use the same name of the variable for the label, or choose a different name. Note: as for variables, the value label name is case-sensitive.\nNext, we specify what each category (i.e. 1 and 2) represents. By checking the metadata document, we see that 1 represents “Male” and 2 represents “Female”. Type the number 1 in the Value: box and the word Male in the Label: box; then click the Add button. Then type the number 2 in the Value: box and the word Female in the Label: box; click the Add button again. The defined value labels for males and females should appear in the box on the left-hand side. When you are done, click the OK button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be returned to the Manage value labels dialog box, which will now have a record for sex_label. By clicking the arrow next to the label name, you will see the codes that you have defined:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, you can close the Manage value labels dialog box by clicking Close.\nPart 2: Applying the value labels to a variable\nNow that the labels are defined, we need to attach them to the relevant variables. Within the Variables Manager, click the variable to be labelled (here, sex). The previously defined label can be assigned to this variable by clicking the Value label drop-down menu, and choosing the appropriate label (here, sex_label), and clicking Apply:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, go to Data &gt; Data utilities &gt; Label utilities &gt; Assign value label to variables. Select sex from the Variables: dropdown box, and select sex_label from the Value label: dropdown box. Click OK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a number of ways that we can confirm that the labelling has been done correctly. One of the easiest ways is to use the codebook command to investigate the coding of sex: Data &gt; Describe data &gt; Describe data contents (codebook).\n\n. codebook sex\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsex                                                                          (unlabeled)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                  type:  numeric (long)\n                 label:  sex_label\n\n                 range:  [1,2]                        units:  1\n         unique values:  2                        missing .:  0/418\n\n            tabulation:  Freq.   Numeric  Label\n                            44         1  Male\n                           374         2  Female\n\nHere we can see that the codes for male and female have been applied correctly. We can also examine the Data Browser and confirm that sex has been labelled.\nNote: If you want to see the original coded values of the labelled groups in the Data Browser window, you can hide the value labels by choosing Tools &gt; Value labels &gt; Hide all value labels for Windows, or View &gt; Value labels &gt; Hide all value labels for Mac from the menu bar in the Data Browser window.\nNow that our categorical variables are labelled, we can produce the one-way frequency tables. As before, choose Statistics &gt; Summaries, tables, and tests &gt; Frequency tables &gt; One-way table. Our newly labelled table for sex appears as below.\n\n        sex |      Freq.     Percent        Cum.\n------------+-----------------------------------\n       Male |         44       10.53       10.53\n     Female |        374       89.47      100.00\n------------+-----------------------------------\n      Total |        418      100.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nCreate and apply value labels for Sex and Vital Status. Produce one-way frequency tables for the categorical variables in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\n1.8.8 Producing a two-way frequency table\nTo produce tables summarising two categorical variables, go to Statistics - Summaries, tables, and tests - Frequency tables - Two-way table with measures of association.\nTo produce a two-way table showing stage of disease by sex using the mod01_pbc.dta data, do the following. In the tabulate2 – two way table with measures of association dialog box, select the variable sex as the Row variable:, and stage as the Column variable: as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick OK to obtain the output below.\n\n. tabulate sex stage\n\n           |                    stage\n       sex |   Stage 1    Stage 2    Stage 3    Stage 4 |     Total\n-----------+--------------------------------------------+----------\n      Male |         3          8         16         17 |        44 \n    Female |        18         84        139        127 |       368 \n-----------+--------------------------------------------+----------\n     Total |        21         92        155        144 |       412 \n\nYou may notice in the above that the number of observations is now 412. This is because there are missing observations for either sex or stage: which is it, and how would you determine this?\nFrom the cross-tabulation, you can see the individual frequencies of participants in each of the categories in each cell. For example, there are 3 male participants who have Stage 1 disease. You can also read the totals for each row and column. For example, there are 44 males, and 144 participants have Stage 4 disease.\nYou can also add percentages into your table. For example, in the tabulate2 – two way table with measures of association dialog box tick the box Within-column relative frequencies for separate percentages of sex within each stage.\n\n. tabulate sex stage, column\n\n+-------------------+\n| Key               |\n|-------------------|\n|     frequency     |\n| column percentage |\n+-------------------+\n\n           |                    stage\n       sex |   Stage 1    Stage 2    Stage 3    Stage 4 |     Total\n-----------+--------------------------------------------+----------\n      Male |         3          8         16         17 |        44 \n           |     14.29       8.70      10.32      11.81 |     10.68 \n-----------+--------------------------------------------+----------\n    Female |        18         84        139        127 |       368 \n           |     85.71      91.30      89.68      88.19 |     89.32 \n-----------+--------------------------------------------+----------\n     Total |        21         92        155        144 |       412 \n           |    100.00     100.00     100.00     100.00 |    100.00 \n\nWe can see that the 3 male participants with Stage 1 disease made up 14% of those with Stage 1 disease.\n\n\n1.8.9 Saving data from Stata\nNow that you have made some changes to the pbc data, it is good practice to save the dataset. Stata uses its own file format to save data. Data saved from Stata will end with the .dta suffix, and will contain useful information such as variable labels and value labels, as well as any new variables created. However, data saved by Stata will only be able to be opened by Stata - you will not easily be able to share your data with colleagues who do not have Stata. To save a Stata dataset, choose File &gt; Save.\nIf you want to share data with colleagues who do not have Stata, you can use File &gt; Export to save your data in another file format (recognising that variable and value labels will not be exported.)\n\n\n1.8.10 Copying output from Stata\nIt is important to note that saving data in Stata will not save your output. Stata data and output are completely separate to one another. The easiest way to retain the output of your analyses is to copy the output into a word processor package (e.g. Microsoft Word) before closing Stata. Once Stata is closed, all the output (that is, all your hard work!) is lost.\nTo copy output from Stata, you can select the output and choose Edit &gt; Copy. This will copy the output as plain text for pasting into a Word document. If you select a single table for copying, you can also Copy table or Copy table as HTML. Whichever way you copy output into Word, you will need to make sure you reformat the table and relabel your header row and column properly for your assignments as described in Module 1. Alternatively, you can copy with the Copy table option for pasting into an Excel worksheet and reformat your table in Excel before pasting into Word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nComplete Table 1 using the output generated in this exercise. You should decide on whether to present continuous variables by their means or medians, and present the most appropriate measure of spread. Include footnotes to indicate if any variables contain missing observations."

    "text": "1.9 Part 3: Creating other types of graphs\n\n1.9.1 Bar graphs\nHere we will create the bar chart shown in Figure 1.3 using the mod01_pbc.dta dataset. The x-axis of this graph will be the stage of disease, and the y-axis will show the number of participants in each category.\nTo create a Bar chart, go to the Stata menu Graphics &gt; Bar chart and the bar-chart dialog box will appear.\n\n1.9.1.1 Simple bar graph\nFor most of our bar graphs, we will be plotting frequencies, so we choose Graph of frequencies within categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a simple bar graph, go to the Categories tab, tick the Group 1 box and choose stage as your first grouping variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the Y axis tab to include a more meaningful label for the y axis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Submit or OK, and the following graph will appear:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Value labels have been assigned to stage to create more meaningful output, and bar colours have been changed to allow for grey-scale printing.\n\n\n\n1.9.2 Submit vs OK button\nYou may note that most dialog boxes in Stata have two choices: the Submit button, and the OK button. Both buttons will submit the command to be run, and both will produce a graph. The Submit button will submit the command but leave the dialog box open, while the OK button will submit the command and close the dialog box. Given the building a graph often involves many incremental changes, the Submit button is a useful option.\n\n\n1.9.3 Clustered bar graph\nTo create a clustered bar chart as shown in Figure 1.7, go to: Graphics &gt; Bar chart again. With the previous settings in place (i.e. stage as grouping variable and with appropriate axes labels), now choose sex as the Group 1 variable, and tick Group 2 and choose stage as the second grouping variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Options tab, tick Treat first category grouping as y variables. When you are done, click OK or Submit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a clustered bar chart, the Group 2 variable is the main variable grouping (here, stage), and each of the Group 2 categories is split by the Group 1 variable (here, sex).\n\n\n1.9.4 Stacked bar graph\nTo create a stacked bar chart shown in Figure 1.8, bring up the Bar chart dialog box, go to the Options tab and tick Stack bars on y variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.9.5 Stacked bar graph of relative frequencies\nIf one wants to compare the sex distribution across the stage categories, it would be convenient if all the bars have the same height (100%). To generate such a bar chart in Stata, tick Base bar heights on percentages in the Options tab of the Bar charts dialog box. Change the y-axis title in the Y axis tab to Percentage of students in each age group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.9.6 Editing graphs in Stata\nThere are two main approaches of editing many aspects of a graph (such as colours, labels, font-size etc). The first approach is to use options within the dialog boxes. For example, if we wanted to use a grey-and-white colour scheme for our bar chart, we can define the colours of the bars in the Bars tab of the bar chart dialog box.\nHere, we will define Bar 1 to be White:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar 2 can be defined to be Gray, resulting in the graph below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second approach to customising graphs is to use the Graph Editor. Each Stata graph window includes a Graph Editor button:\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph editor button on Stata for Windows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph editor button on Stata for MacOS\n\n\n\n\nThe Graph Editor window comprises two main sections: the graph that can be edited on the left, and a list of elements of the graph on the right. Most aspects of a graph’s appearance can be edited in the Graph Editor, usually by double-clicking an element (e.g. a bar, or a bar segment) and changing its properties. There are too many ways to change a graph’s appearance to document here: feel free to explore and experiment!\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph editor window: Windows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph editor window: MacOS\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are done editing in the Graph Editor, click the Graph Editor icon again to stop the Graph Editor. You will be prompted to save your graph. You can click the Save button, choose Save as and choose to save using the PNG (*.png) format. You can then insert your saved PNG file into your word processing package as usual.\n\n\n1.9.7 Creating line graphs\nTo demonstrate the graphing of aggregate data with Stata, we use the data on new cases and deaths from prostate cancer in males in NSW. This data has been entered into Stata as mod01_prostate_cancer.dta.\nIf you look at the data in the Data Editor window, you will see that there are 20 rows - a row for each year of data. Each row contains the number of new cases (NCases), number of deaths (NDeaths), the incidence rate (RCases) and death rate (RDeaths).\nTo create a line graph as in Figure 1.9 select Graphics &gt; Twoway graph (scatter, line, etc.) and click the Create… button in the twoway – Twoway graphs dialog box to bring up a dialog box for defining Plot 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Line as the plot type, rcases as the Y variable and year as the X variable as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Accept, and then click Submit to check how the graph looks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks ok, but we want to add the death rate to the plot. Click Create… again and add a Plot 2 for mortality rate:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Line as the plot type again, rdeaths as the Y variable and year as the X variable. Click Accept, and then Submit to check how the graph looks like now. You should see both variables plotted:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the format of either line, click the relevant plot definition in the main twoway dialog box and click Edit. Click the Line properties button and choose a Pattern (e.g. Short-dash), then click Submit again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we need an appropriate label for the y-axis. In the main twoway dialog box, click on the Y axis tab and label the title appropriately (e.g. Age-standardardised rate and then click OK or Submit. The graph below should be produced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Command: twoway (line rcases year) (line rdeaths year, lpattern(shortdash)), ytitle(Age-standardised rate)]"

    "text": "1.10 Part 1: An introduction to R\n“R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.” Link. It is an open-source programming language, used mainly for statistics (including biostatistics) and data science.\nThe aim of these notes is to introduce the R language within the RStudio environment, and to introduce the commands and procedures that are directly relevant to this course. There is so much more to R than we can cover in these notes. Relevant information will be provided throughout the course, and we will provide further references that you can explore if you are interested.\n\n1.10.1 R vs RStudio\nAt its heart, R is a programming language. When you install R on your computer, you are installing the language and its resources, as well as a very basic interface for using R. You can write and run R code using the basic R app, but it’s not recommended.\nRStudio is an “Integrated Development Environment” that runs R while also providing useful tools to help you write code and analyse data. You can think of R as an engine which does the work, and RStudio as a car that uses the engine, but also provides useful tools like GPS navigation and reversing cameras that help you drive.\nNote: even though we recommend that you use RStudio, you still need install R. RStudio will not run without R installed.\nIn summary, we recommend you use RStudio to write R code.\n\n\n1.10.2 Installing R and RStudio\n\n1.10.2.1 To install R on your computer\n\nDownload the R installer from:\n\nfor Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/\nfor MacOS: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/\n\nInstall R by running the installer and following the installation instructions. The default settings are fine.\n\nNote for macOS: if you are running macOS 10.8 or later, you may need to install an additional application called XQuartz, which is available at https://www.xquartz.org/. Download the latest installer (XQuartz-2.8.5.dmg as of May 2024), and install it in the usual way.\n\nOpen the R program. You should see a screen similar to below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNear the bottom of the R screen, you will find the “&gt;” symbol which represents the command line. If you type 1 + 2 into the command line and then hit enter you should get:\n[1] 3\nThis is R performing your calculation, with the [1] indicating that the solution to 1 + 2 is a single number (the number 3).\nAt this point, close R - we will not interact with R like this in the future. You can close R by typing quit() at the command prompt, followed by the return key, or in the usual way of closing an application in your operating system. There is no need to save anything here if prompted.\n\n\n1.10.2.2 To install RStudio on your computer\n\nMake sure you have already installed R, and verified that it is working.\nDownload the RStudio desktop installer at: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. The website should detect your operating system and link to the appropriate installer for your computer.\nInstall RStudio by running the installer and following the installation instructions. The default settings are fine.\nOpen RStudio, which will appear similar to the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate the command line symbol “&gt;” at the bottom of the left-hand panel. Type 1 + 2 into the command line and hit enter, and you will see:\n[1] 3\nThis confirms that RStudio is running correctly, and can use the R language to correctly calculate the sum between 1 and 2!\nRStudio currently comprises three window panes, and we will discuss these later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nInstall R and RStudio and confirm they are both working correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10.3 Recommended setup\nI will provide a recommended setup for R and RStudio in this section. You are free to use alternative workflows and setup, but this setup works well in practice.\n\n1.10.3.1 RStudio preferences\nBy default, RStudio will retain data, scripts and other objects when you quit your RStudio session. Relying on this can cause headaches, so I recommend that you set up RStudio so that it does not preserve your workspace between sessions. Open the RStudio options:\n\nMac: Edit &gt; Settings\nWindows: Tools &gt; Global Options\n\nand deselect “Restore .RData into workplace at startup”, and choose: “Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10.3.2 Set up a project\nA project in RStudio is a folder that RStudio recognises as a place to store R scripts, data files, figures that are common to an analysis project. Setting up a folder allows much more simple navigation and specification of data files and output. More detail can be found in Chapter 8 of the excellent text: R for Data Science. Using projects is not necessary, but I recommend working with projects from day one.\nWe will create a project called PHCM9795 to store all the data you will use and scripts that you will write in this course. First, think about where you want to store your project folder: this could be somewhere in your Documents folder.\nStep 1: Choose File &gt; New Project… in RStudio to open the Create Project dialog box:\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Click the first option to create a project in a New directory\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Click the first option: New Project. Give the project a name, by typing PHCM9795 in the “Directory name”, and choose where you want to store the project by clicking the Browse button.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Click Create to create your project.\nYou will now have a new folder in your directory, which contains only one file: PHCM9795.Rproj, and the two right-hand panes of RStudio will appear as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nCreate a new project called PHCM9795.\n\n\nThe top-right menu bar is showing that you are working within the PHCM9795 project, and the bottom-right window is showing the contents of that window: the single PHCM9795.Rproj file. We will add some more files to this project later.\n\n\n\n1.10.4 A simple R analysis\nIn this very brief section, we will introduce R by calculating the average of six ages.\nTo begin, open a new R Script by choosing File &gt; New file &gt; R Script . A script (or a program) is a collection of commands that are sequentially processed by R. You can also type Ctrl+Shift+N in Windows, or Command+Shift+N in MacOS to open a new script in RStudio, or click the New File button at the top of the RStudio window.\nYou should now see four window panes, as below. In the top-left window, type the following (replacing my name with yours, and including today’s date):\n\n# Author: Timothy Dobbins\n# Date: 5 April 2024\n# Purpose: My first R script\n\nage &lt;- c(20, 25, 23, 29, 21, 27)\nsummary(age)\n\nNote: R is case-sensitive, so you should enter the text exactly as written in these notes.\nYour screen should look something like:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo run your script, choose Code &gt; Run Region &gt; Run All. You will see your code appear in the bottom-left window, with the following output:\n\n&gt; # Author: Timothy Dobbins\n&gt; # Date: 5 April 2024\n&gt; # Purpose: My first R script\n&gt; \n&gt; age &lt;- c(20, 25, 23, 29, 21, 27)\n\n&gt; summary(age)\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  20.00   21.50   24.00   24.17   26.50   29.00 \n\nWe will explain the key parts of this script later, but for now, you have entered six ages and calculated the mean age (along with five other summary statistics).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nType the code above into the top-left window, and run the script.\nSave your script within the PHCM9795 project by using File &gt; Save As, using the name my_first_analysis.R.\n\n\n\n\n1.10.5 The RStudio environment\nNow that we have seen a simple example of how to use R within RStudio, let’s describe the RStudio environment. Let’s assume that you have just run your first R script, and you have four windows as below:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top-left window is call the Source window, and is where you write and edit your R scripts. Scripts can be saved by clicking File &gt; Save As or by clicking on the symbol of a floppy disk at the top of the script. The file will have an extension of .R, for example script.R. Remember to give your script a meaningful title and remember to periodically save as you go.\nIn RStudio, the name of the script will be black when it has been saved, and will change to red if you have any unsaved changes.\nThe Console window, at the bottom left, contains the command line which is indicated with the symbol &gt;. You can type commands here, but anything executed directly from the console is not saved and therefore is lost when the session ends (when you exit RStudio). You should always run your commands from a script file which you can save and use again later. When you run commands from a script, the output and any notes/errors are shown in the console. The Terminal and Jobs tabs will not be used in this course.\nThe Environment window at the top-right shows a list of objects that have been created during your session. When you close your RStudio session these objects will disappear. We will not use the History or Connections tabs in this course.\nThe bottom right corner contains some useful tabs, in particular the Help tab. When you are troubleshooting errors or learning how to use a function, the Help tab should be the first place you visit. Here you can search the help documents for all the packages you have installed. Whenever you create plots in R, these will be shown in the Plots tab. The Packages tab contains a list of installed packages and indicates which ones are currently in use (we will learn about packages later). Packages which are loaded, i.e. in use, are indicated with a tick. Some packages are in use by default when you begin a new session. You can access information about a package by clicking on its name. The Files tab provides a shortcut to access your files. The Viewer tab will not be used in this course.\n\n\n1.10.6 Some R basics\nWhile we use R as a statistics package, R is a programming language. In order to use R effectively, we need to define some basics.\n\n1.10.6.1 Scripts\nWhile R can be run completely from the command line, issuing commands one-by-one, it is most commonly run using scripts. A script is simply a list of commands that are processed in order. The simple analysis we conducted earlier is a very simple script. Some things to know about R scripts:\n\nanything appearing after a # is a comment, and is ignored by R. The first three lines of our script are there for ourselves (either as writers of code, or readers of code). I include comments at the beginning of each of my scripts to describe:\n\nwho wrote the script (useful if someone else uses your script and wants to ask questions about it);\nwhen the script was written;\nwhat the script does. This last point may seem odd, but it’s useful to describe what this script does, and why it might differ to other scripts being used in the analysis. This is particularly useful if your scripts become long and complex.\n\nR is case-sensitive. So age, AGE and Age could refer to three separate variables (please don’t do this!)\nuse blank lines and comments to separate sections of your script\n\n\n\n1.10.6.2 Objects\nIf you do some reading about R, you may learn that R is an “object-oriented programming language”. When we enter or import data into R, we are asking R to create objects from our data. These objects can be manipulated and transformed by functions, to obtain useful insights from our data.\nObjects in R are created using the assignment operator. The most common form of the assignment operator looks like an arrow: &lt;- and is typed as the &lt; and - symbols. The simplest way of reading &lt;- is as the words “is defined as”. Note that it possible to use -&gt; and even = as assignment operators, but their use is less frequent.\nLet’s see an example:\n\nx &lt;- 42\n\nThis command creates a new object called x, which is defined as the number 42 (or in words, “x is defined as 42”). Running this command gives no output in the console, but the new object appears in the top-right Environment panel. We can view the object in the console by typing its name:\n\n# Print the object x\nx\n\n[1] 42\n\n\nNow we see the contents of x in the console.\nThis example is rather trivial, and we rarely assign objects of just one value. In fact, we created an object earlier, called age, which comprised six values.\n\n\n1.10.6.3 Data structures\nThere are two main structures we will use to work with data in this course: vectors and data frames. A vector is a combination of data values, all of the same type. For example, our six ages that we entered earlier is a vector. You could think of a vector as a column of data (even though R prints vectors as rows!) And technically, even an object with only one value is a vector, a vector of size 1.\nThe easiest way of creating a vector in R is by using the c() function, where c stands for ‘combine’. In our previous Simple Analysis in R (Section 1.10.4), we wrote the command:\n\nage &lt;- c(20, 25, 23, 29, 21, 27)\n\nThis command created a new object called age, and combined the six values of age into one vector.\nJust as having a vector of size 1 is unusual, having just one column of data to analyse is also pretty unusual. The other structure we will describe here is a data frame which is essentially a collection of vectors, each of the same size. You could think of a data frame as being like a spreadsheet, with columns representing variables, and rows representing observations.\nThere are other structures in R, such as matrices and lists, which we won’t discuss in this course. And you may come across the term tibble, which is a type of data frame.\n\n\n1.10.6.4 Functions\nIf objects are the nouns of R, functions are the verbs. Essentially, functions transform objects. Functions can transform your data into summary statistics, graphical summaries or analysis results. For example, we used the summary() function to display summary statistics for our six ages.\nR functions are specified by their arguments (or inputs). The arguments that can be supplied for each function can be inspected by examining the help notes for that function. To obtain help for a function, we can submit help(summary) (or equivalently ?summary) in the console, or we can use the Help tab in the bottom-right window of RStudio. For example, the first part of the help notes for summary appear as:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe help notes in R can be quite cryptic, but the Usage section details what inputs should be specified for the function to run. Here, summary requires an object to be specified. In our case, we specified age, which is our object defined as the vector of six ages.\nMost help pages also include some examples of how you might use the function. These can be found at the very bottom of the help page.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summary() function is quite simple, in that it only requires one input, the object to be summarised. More complex functions might require a number of inputs. For example, the help notes for the descriptives() function in the jmv package show a large number of inputs can be specified:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two things to note here. First, notice that the first two inputs are listed with no = symbol, but all other inputs are listed with = symbols (with values provided after the = symbol). This means that everything apart from data and vars have default values. We are free to not specify values for these inputs if we are happy with the defaults provided. For example, by default the variance is not calculated (as variance = FALSE). To obtain the variance as well as the standard deviation, we can change this default to variance = TRUE:\n\n# Only the standard deviation is provided as the measure of variability\ndescriptives(data=pbc, vars=age)\n\n# Additionally request the variance to be calculated\ndescriptives(data=pbc, vars=age, variance=TRUE)\n\nSecond, for functions with multiple inputs, we can specify the input name and its value, or we can ignore the input name and specify just the input values in the order listed in the Usage section. So the following are equivalent:\n\n# We can specify that the dataset to be summarised is pbc,\n#   and the variable to summarise is age:\ndescriptives(data=pbc, vars=age)\n\n# We can omit the input name, as long as we keep the inputs in the correct order - \n#   that is, dataset first, variable second:\ndescriptives(pbc, age)\n\n# We can change the order of the inputs, as long as we specify the input name:\ndescriptives(vars=age, data=pbc)\n\nIn this course, we will usually provide all the input names, even when they are not required. As you become more familiar with R, you will start to use the shortcut method.\n\n\n1.10.6.5 The curse of inconsistency\nAs R is an open-source project, many people have contributed to its development. This has led to a frustrating part of R: some functions require a single object to be specified, but some require you to specify a data frame and select variables for analysis. Let’s see an example.\nThe help for summary() specifies the usage as: summary(object, ...). This means we need to specify a single object to be summarised. An object could be a single column of data (i.e. a vector), or it could be a data frame. If we have a data frame called pbc which contains many variables, the command summary(pbc) would summarise every variable in the data frame.\nWhat if we only wanted to summarise the age of the participants in the data frame? To select a single variable from a data frame, we can use the following syntax: dataframe$variable. So to summarise just age from this data frame, we would use: summary(pbc$age).\nCompare this with the descriptives() function in the jmv package. We saw earlier that the two required inputs for descriptives() are data (the data frame to be analysed) and vars (the variables to be analysed). So to summarise age from the pbc data frame, we would specify descriptives(data=pbc, vars=age).\nThis inconsistency will seem maddening at first, and will continue to be maddening! Reading the usage section of the help pages is a useful way to determine whether you should specify an object (like pbc$age) or a data frame and a list of variables.\n\n\n\n1.10.7 Packages\nA package is a collection of functions, documentation (and sometimes datasets) that extend the capabilities of R. Packages have been written by R users to be freely distributed and used by others. R packages can be obtained from many sources, but the most common source is CRAN: the Comprehensive R Archive Network.\nA useful way of thinking about R is that R is like a smartphone, with packages being like apps which are downloaded from CRAN (similar to an app-store). When you first install R, it comes with a basic set of packages (apps) installed. You can do a lot of things with these basic packages, but sometimes you might want to do things differently, or you may want to perform some analyses that can’t be done using the default packages. In these cases, you can install a package.\nLike installing an app on a smartphone, you only need to install a package once. But each time you want to use the package, you need to load the package into R.\n\n1.10.7.1 How to install a package\nThere are a couple of ways to install a package. You can use the install.packages() function if you know the exact name of the package. Let’s use an example of installing the skimr package, which gives a very nice, high-level overview of any data frame. We can install skimr by typing the following into the console:\n\ninstall.packages(\"skimr\")\n\nNote the use of the quotation marks.\nAlternatively, RStudio offers a graphical way of installing packages that can be accessed via Tools &gt; Install Packages, or via the Install button at the top of the Packages tab in the bottom-right window. You can begin typing the name of the package in the dialog box that appears, and RStudio will use predictive text to offer possible packages:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile writing code is usually the recommended way to use R, installing packages is an exception. Using Tools &gt; Install Packages is perfectly fine, because you only need to install a package once.\n\n\n1.10.7.2 How to load a package\nWhen you begin a new session in RStudio, i.e. when you open RStudio, only certain core packages are automatically loaded. You can use the library() function to load a package that you has previously been installed. For example, now that we have installed skimr, we need to load it before we can use it:\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nNote that quotation marks are not required for the library() function (although they can be included if you really like quotation marks!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nInstall the packages jmv and skimr using Tools &gt; Install packages, or by typing into the console:\ninstall.packages(\"jmv\")\ninstall.packages(\"skimr\")\n\n\n\n\n1.10.7.3 Installing vs loading packages\nPackage installation:\n\nuse the install.packages() function (note the ‘s’) or Tools &gt; Install packages\nthe package name must be surrounded by quotation marks\nonly needs to be done once\n\nPackage loading\n\nuse the library() function\nthe package name does not need to be surrounded by quotation marks\nmust be done for each R session\n\n\n\n\n1.10.8 What is this thing called the tidyverse?\nIf you have done much reading about R, you may have come across the tidyverse:\n\n“The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.” https://www.tidyverse.org/\n\nPackages in the tidyverse have been designed with a goal to make using R more consistent by defining a “grammar” to manipulate data, examine data and draw conclusions from data. While the tidyverse is a common and powerful set of packages, we will not be teaching the tidyverse in this course for two main reasons:\n\nThe data we provide have been saved in a relatively tidy way, and do not need much manipulation for analyses to be conducted. The cognitive load in learning the tidyverse in this course is greater than the benefit that could be gained.\nThere are many resources (online, in print etc) that are based on base R, and do not use the tidyverse. It would be difficult to understand these resources if we taught only tidyverse techniques. In particular, the dataframe$variable syntax is an important concept that should be understood before moving into the tidyverse.\n\nIn saying all of this, I think the tidyverse is an excellent set of packages, which I frequently use. At the completion of this course, you will be well equipped to teach yourself tidyverse using many excellent resources such as: Tidyverse Skills for Data Science and R for Data Science."

The data come from a study in primary biliary cirrhosis, a condition of the liver, from Modeling Survival Data: Extending the Cox Model Therneau and Grambsch (2010). By the end of this exercise, we will have completed the following table.\n\n\n\n\nSummary of 418 participants from the PBC study (Therneau and Grambsch, 2000)\nCharacteristic Summary\n\nAge (years)Mean (SD) or Median [IQR]\n\nSexMalen (%)\n\nFemalen (%)\n\nAST* (U/ml)Mean (SD) or Median [IQR]\n\nSerum bilirubinMean (SD) or Median [IQR]\n\nStageIn (%)\n\nIIn (%)\n\nIIIn (%)\n\nIVn (%)\n\nVital status at study endAlive: no transplantn (%)\n\nAlive: transplantn (%)\n\nDeceasedn (%)\n\n* asparate aminotransferase\n\n\n\n\nThis table is available in Table1.docx, saved on Moodle.\n\n1.11.1 Set up your data\nWe created a project in the previous step. We will now create a folder to store all the data for this course. Storing the data within the project makes life much easier!\nCreate a new folder by clicking the New Folder icon in the Files tab at the bottom-right:\n\n\n\n\n\nCall the new folder data.\nClick on this folder to open it, and then create two new folders: activities and examples.\nDownload the “Data sets: for learning activities” from Moodle, and use Windows Explorer or MacOS Finder to save these data sets in activities. Save the “Data sets: example data from course notes” into the examples folder.\nYour activities folder should look like:\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the two dots next to the up-arrow at the top of the folder contents to move back up the folder structure. Note that you need to click the dots, and not the up-facing green arrow!\n\n\n1.11.2 Reading a data file\nTyping data directly into R is not common; we usually read data that have been previously saved. In this example, we will read an .rds file using the readRDS() function, which has only one input: the location of the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\n1 - Confirm that the mod01_pdc.rds file is in the activities sub-folder within the data folder (as per the previous steps).\n2 - Load the skimr package, and use the readRDS() function to read the file into R, assigning it to a data frame called pbc. Because we set up our project, we can locate our data easily by telling R to use the file: \"data/activities/mod01_pdc.rds\", which translates as: the file mod01_pdc.rds which is located in the activities sub-folder within the data folder.\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\npbc &lt;- readRDS(\"data/activities/mod01_pbc.rds\")\n\n3 - We can now use the summary() function to examine the pbc dataset:\n\nsummary(pbc)\n\n       id             time          status            trt       \n Min.   :  1.0   Min.   :  41   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:105.2   1st Qu.:1093   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:1.000  \n Median :209.5   Median :1730   Median :0.0000   Median :1.000  \n Mean   :209.5   Mean   :1918   Mean   :0.8301   Mean   :1.494  \n 3rd Qu.:313.8   3rd Qu.:2614   3rd Qu.:2.0000   3rd Qu.:2.000  \n Max.   :418.0   Max.   :4795   Max.   :2.0000   Max.   :2.000  \n                                                 NA's   :106    \n      age             sex           ascites            hepato      \n Min.   :26.28   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.00000   Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:42.83   1st Qu.:2.000   1st Qu.:0.00000   1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :51.00   Median :2.000   Median :0.00000   Median :1.0000  \n Mean   :50.74   Mean   :1.895   Mean   :0.07692   Mean   :0.5128  \n 3rd Qu.:58.24   3rd Qu.:2.000   3rd Qu.:0.00000   3rd Qu.:1.0000  \n Max.   :78.44   Max.   :2.000   Max.   :1.00000   Max.   :1.0000  \n                                 NA's   :106       NA's   :106     \n    spiders           edema             bili             chol       \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   : 0.300   Min.   : 120.0  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.: 0.800   1st Qu.: 249.5  \n Median :0.0000   Median :0.0000   Median : 1.400   Median : 309.5  \n Mean   :0.2885   Mean   :0.1005   Mean   : 3.221   Mean   : 369.5  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:0.0000   3rd Qu.: 3.400   3rd Qu.: 400.0  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :28.000   Max.   :1775.0  \n NA's   :106                                        NA's   :134     \n    albumin          copper          alkphos             ast        \n Min.   :1.960   Min.   :  4.00   Min.   :  289.0   Min.   : 26.35  \n 1st Qu.:3.243   1st Qu.: 41.25   1st Qu.:  871.5   1st Qu.: 80.60  \n Median :3.530   Median : 73.00   Median : 1259.0   Median :114.70  \n Mean   :3.497   Mean   : 97.65   Mean   : 1982.7   Mean   :122.56  \n 3rd Qu.:3.770   3rd Qu.:123.00   3rd Qu.: 1980.0   3rd Qu.:151.90  \n Max.   :4.640   Max.   :588.00   Max.   :13862.4   Max.   :457.25  \n                 NA's   :108      NA's   :106       NA's   :106     \n      trig           platelet        protime          stage      \n Min.   : 33.00   Min.   : 62.0   Min.   : 9.00   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.: 84.25   1st Qu.:188.5   1st Qu.:10.00   1st Qu.:2.000  \n Median :108.00   Median :251.0   Median :10.60   Median :3.000  \n Mean   :124.70   Mean   :257.0   Mean   :10.73   Mean   :3.024  \n 3rd Qu.:151.00   3rd Qu.:318.0   3rd Qu.:11.10   3rd Qu.:4.000  \n Max.   :598.00   Max.   :721.0   Max.   :18.00   Max.   :4.000  \n NA's   :136      NA's   :11      NA's   :2       NA's   :6      \n\n\nAn alternative to the summary() function is the skim() function in the skimr package, which produces summary statistics as well as rudimentary histograms:\n\nskim(pbc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summary() and skim() functions are useful to give a quick overview of a dataset: how many variables are included, how variables are coded, which variables contain missing data and a crude histogram showing the distribution of numeric variables.\n\n\n1.11.3 Summarising continuous variables\nOne of the most flexible functions for summarising continuous variables is the descriptives() function from the jmv package. The function is specified as descriptives(data=, vars=) where:\n\ndata specifies the dataframe to be analysed\nvars specifies the variable(s) of interest, with multiple variables combined using the c() function\n\nWe can summarise the three continuous variables in the pbc data: age, AST and serum bilirubin, as shown below.\n\nlibrary(jmv)\n\ndescriptives(data=pbc, vars=c(age, ast, bili))\n\n\n DESCRIPTIVES\n\n Descriptives                                                \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n                         age         ast         bili        \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   N                          418         312          418   \n   Missing                      0         106            0   \n   Mean                  50.74155    122.5563     3.220813   \n   Median                51.00068    114.7000     1.400000   \n   Standard deviation    10.44721    56.69952     4.407506   \n   Minimum               26.27789    26.35000    0.3000000   \n   Maximum               78.43943    457.2500     28.00000   \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n\n\nBy default, the descriptives function presents the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. We can request additional statistics, such as the quartiles (which are called the percentiles, or pc, in the descriptives function):\n\ndescriptives(data=pbc, vars=c(age, ast, bili), pc=TRUE)\n\n\n DESCRIPTIVES\n\n Descriptives                                                \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n                         age         ast         bili        \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   N                          418         312          418   \n   Missing                      0         106            0   \n   Mean                  50.74155    122.5563     3.220813   \n   Median                51.00068    114.7000     1.400000   \n   Standard deviation    10.44721    56.69952     4.407506   \n   Minimum               26.27789    26.35000    0.3000000   \n   Maximum               78.43943    457.2500     28.00000   \n   25th percentile       42.83231    80.60000    0.8000000   \n   50th percentile       51.00068    114.7000     1.400000   \n   75th percentile       58.24093    151.9000     3.400000   \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n\n\n\n\n1.11.4 Producing a histogram\nWe can use the hist() function to produce a frequency histogram, specifying the dataframe to use and the variable to be plotted as dataframe$variable:\n\nhist(pbc$age)\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram function does a remarkably good job of choosing cutpoints and binwidths, and these rarely need to be changed. However, the labelling of the histogram should be improved by using xlab=\" \" and main=\" \" to assign labels for the x-axis and overall title respectively:\n\nhist(pbc$age, xlab=\"Age (years)\", \n     main=\"Frequency histogram of participant age from pbc study data\")\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the hist() function plots a frequency histogram, with counts on the y-axis. We can plot a density histogram using the following code:\n\nh &lt;- hist(pbc$age, freq=FALSE,\n     xlab=\"Age (years)\", \n     main=\"Density histogram of participant age from pbc study data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.11.5 Producing a boxplot\nThe boxplot function is used to produce boxplots, again specifying the dataframe to use and the variable to be plotted as dataframe$variable. Labels can be applied in the same way as the histogram:\n\nboxplot(pbc$age, xlab=\"Age (years)\", \n   main=\"Boxplot of participant age from pbc study data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.11.6 Producing a one-way frequency table\nWe have three categorical variables to summarise in Table 1: sex, stage and vital status. These variables are best summarised using one-way frequency tables, which can be constructed using the descriptives function from the jmv package, with the freq = TRUE option. Before constructing frequency tables however, we must define the variables as categorical variables, by converting them to factors.\n\n1.11.6.1 Defining categorical variables as factors\nTo define a categorical variable as such in R, we define it as a factor using the factor function:\nfactor(variable=, levels=, labels=)\nWe specify:\n\nlevels: the values the categorical variable can take\nlabels: the labels corresponding to each of the levels (entered in the same order as the levels)\n\nTo define our variable sex as a factor, we use:\n\npbc$sex &lt;- factor(pbc$sex, levels=c(1, 2), \n   labels=c(\"Male\", \"Female\"))\n\nWe can then produce a frequency table:\n\ndescriptives(data=pbc, vars=sex, freq=TRUE)\n\n\n DESCRIPTIVES\n\n Descriptives                  \n ───────────────────────────── \n                         sex   \n ───────────────────────────── \n   N                     418   \n   Missing                 0   \n   Mean                        \n   Median                      \n   Standard deviation          \n   Minimum                     \n   Maximum                     \n ───────────────────────────── \n\n\n FREQUENCIES\n\n Frequencies of sex                                 \n ────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   sex       Counts    % of Total    Cumulative %   \n ────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   Male          44      10.52632        10.52632   \n   Female       374      89.47368       100.00000   \n ────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n\n\n\nTask: define stage and status (Vital Status) as factors, and produce one-way frequency tables. Refer to the file pbc_info.txt to view the labels for each variable. For example, for Stage:\n\n\npbc$stage &lt;- factor(pbc$stage, levels=c(1, 2, 3, 4), \n   labels=c(\"Stage 1\", \"Stage 2\", \"Stage 3\", \"Stage 4\"))\n\n\n\n\n1.11.7 Producing a two-way frequency table\nTo produce tables summarising two categorical variables, we can use the contTables() function within the jmv package. The minimal inputs to include are data: the name of the data frame to be analysed, rows: the variable representing the rows of the table, and cols: the name of the columns of the table.\nFor example, to produce a two-way table showing stage of disease by sex using the pbc data frame, we use:\n\ncontTables(data=pbc, rows=sex, cols=stage)\n\n\n CONTINGENCY TABLES\n\n Contingency Tables                                              \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   sex       Stage 1    Stage 2    Stage 3    Stage 4    Total   \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   Male            3          8         16         17       44   \n   Female         18         84        139        127      368   \n   Total          21         92        155        144      412   \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n\n\n χ² Tests                               \n ────────────────────────────────────── \n         Value        df    p           \n ────────────────────────────────────── \n   χ²    0.8779873     3    0.8307365   \n   N           412                      \n ────────────────────────────────────── \n\n\n[The bottom part of the output, χ² Tests, can be ignored for now]\nYou may notice in the above that the number of observations is now 412. This is because there are missing observations for either sex or stage: which is it, and how would you determine this?\nFrom the cross-tabulation, you can see the individual frequencies of participants in each of the categories in each cell. For example, there are 3 male participants who have Stage 1 disease. You can also read the totals for each row and column. For example, there are 44 males, and 144 participants have Stage 4 disease.\nYou can also add percentages into your table using pcCol=TRUE to include column percents, and pcRow=TRUE for row percents. For example, to calculate the relative frequencies (i.e. percentages) of sex within each stage, we would request column percents with the option: pcCol=TRUE.\n\ncontTables(data=pbc, rows=sex, cols=stage, pcCol=TRUE)\n\n\n CONTINGENCY TABLES\n\n Contingency Tables                                                                             \n ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   sex                          Stage 1      Stage 2      Stage 3      Stage 4      Total       \n ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   Male      Observed                   3            8           16           17           44   \n             % within column     14.28571      8.69565     10.32258     11.80556     10.67961   \n                                                                                                \n   Female    Observed                  18           84          139          127          368   \n             % within column     85.71429     91.30435     89.67742     88.19444     89.32039   \n                                                                                                \n   Total     Observed                  21           92          155          144          412   \n             % within column    100.00000    100.00000    100.00000    100.00000    100.00000   \n ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n\n\n χ² Tests                               \n ────────────────────────────────────── \n         Value        df    p           \n ────────────────────────────────────── \n   χ²    0.8779873     3    0.8307365   \n   N           412                      \n ────────────────────────────────────── \n\n\nWe can see that the 3 male participants with Stage 1 disease represent 14% of those with Stage 1 disease.\n\n\n1.11.8 Saving data in R\nThere are many ways to save data from R, depending on the type of file you want to save. The recommendation for this course is to save your data using the .rds format, using the saveRDS() function, which takes two inputs: saveRDS(object, file). Here, object is the R object to be saved (usually a data frame), and file is the location for the file to be saved (file name and path, including the .rds suffix).\nIt is not necessary to save our PBC data, as we have made only minor changes to the data that can be replicated by rerunning our script. If you had made major changes and wanted to save your data, you could use:\nsaveRDS(pbc, file=\"pbc_revised.rds\")\n\n\n1.11.9 Copying output from R\nIt is important to note that saving your data or your script in R will not save your output. The easiest way to retain the output of your analyses is to copy the output from the Console into a word processor package (e.g. Microsoft Word) before closing R.\nUnfortunately, by default, R is not ideal for creating publication quality tables. There are many packages that will help in this process, such as R Markdown, huxtable, gt and gtsummary, but their use is beyond the scope of this course. R Markdown for Scientists provides an excellent introduction to R Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nComplete Table 1 using the output generated in this exercise. You should decide on whether to present continuous variables by their means or medians, and present the most appropriate measure of spread. Include footnotes to indicate if any variables contain missing observations."

    "text": "1.12 Part 3: Creating other types of graphs\nThe plot() function, also known as base graphics, is the default method of plotting data in R that can produce publication-quality graphics with minimal coding. There are alternative packages for plotting, with ggplot2 being one of the most well known. We will present instructions for base graphics in this course, but excellent documentation for ggplot2 can be found at the ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis website, written by the package authors.\n\n1.12.1 Bar graphs\nThe simplest way to use the plot() function is by specifying an object to be plotted. As with the hist() function, to plot a single variable from a data frame, we must define it using: dataframe$variable.\nHere we will create the bar chart shown in Figure 1.3 of the statistics notes using the mod01_pdc.rds dataset. The x-axis of this graph will be the stage of disease, and the y-axis will show the number of participants in each category.\n\nplot(pbc$stage, \n     main=\"Bar graph of stage of disease from PBC study\", \n     ylab=\"Number of participants\")\n\n\n\n\nNote that stage is a categorical variable, that has been defined as a factor (in Section 1.11.6.1). You must define categorical data as factors to plot them in a bar graph.\n\n1.12.1.1 Clustered bar graph\nTo create a clustered bar chart as shown in Figure 1.7 of the statistics notes, we need to do a bit of manipulation. We first need to tabulate the data using the table() function. We want to plot stage of disease broken down by sex, so we specify sex as the first variable, and stage as the second variable for the table() command.\n\ncounts &lt;- table(pbc$sex, pbc$stage)\ncounts\n\n        \n         Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4\n  Male         3       8      16      17\n  Female      18      84     139     127\n\n\nAfter tabulating the data, we use the barplot() function to plot the summarised data. We specify the main title using main=\" \", specify that the stages be plotted separately by sex (beside=TRUE), specify the legend be defined by sex, and position the legend in the top-left of the graph:\n\nbarplot(counts, main=\"Bar graph of stage of disease by sex from PBC study\",\n        beside=TRUE, legend = rownames(counts), args.legend = list(x = \"topleft\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.12.1.2 Stacked bar graph\nA stacked bar graph can be constructed as for the clustered bar graph, but we specify beside=FALSE:\n\nbarplot(counts, main=\"Bar graph of stage of disease by sex from PBC study\",\n        beside=FALSE, legend = rownames(counts), args.legend = list(x = \"topleft\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.12.1.3 Stacked bar graph of relative frequencies\nTo plot relative frequencies, we need to transform our table of frequencies (counts) into proportions, by using the prop.table() function. The prop.table() function takes two arguments: a table of counts, and margin, which defines whether we want proportions calculated by row (margin=1) or column (margin=2).\nWe want to calculate the relative frequency of sex within each stage category. From our counts table above, this equates to calculating column proportions, so we specify margin=2. We also multiply the resulting table by 100 to obtain percentages (rather than proportions):\n\npercent &lt;- prop.table(counts, margin=2)*100\npercent\n\n        \n           Stage 1   Stage 2   Stage 3   Stage 4\n  Male   14.285714  8.695652 10.322581 11.805556\n  Female 85.714286 91.304348 89.677419 88.194444\n\n\nAfter calculating the percentages, we use barplot() again, similar to the stacked bar graph:\n\nbarplot(percent, \n        main=\"Relative frequency of sex within stage of disease from PBC study\",\n        legend = rownames(counts), beside=FALSE, args.legend = list(x = \"topright\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.12.2 Creating line graphs\nTo demonstrate the graphing of aggregate data , we use the data on new cases and deaths from prostate cancer in males in NSW. This data has been entered as mod01_prostate_cancer.rds.\n\ncancer &lt;- readRDS(\"data/examples/mod01_prostate_cancer.rds\")\nsummary(cancer)\n\n      year          ncases        ndeaths           rcases         rdeaths     \n Min.   :1987   Min.   :1567   Min.   : 645.0   Min.   : 81.8   Min.   :31.10  \n 1st Qu.:1992   1st Qu.:2804   1st Qu.: 788.2   1st Qu.:121.9   1st Qu.:34.67  \n Median :1996   Median :3790   Median : 868.0   Median :131.3   Median :36.55  \n Mean   :1996   Mean   :3719   Mean   : 855.0   Mean   :135.4   Mean   :37.09  \n 3rd Qu.:2001   3rd Qu.:4403   3rd Qu.: 921.0   3rd Qu.:164.2   3rd Qu.:40.38  \n Max.   :2006   Max.   :6158   Max.   :1044.0   Max.   :186.9   Max.   :43.80  \n\n\nWe begin by plotting cancer cases (as the y variable) against year (the x variable).\n\nplot(x=cancer$year, y=cancer$rcases)\n\n\n\n\nLet’s define the plot to be joined by lines (type=\"l\"), in the colour red (col=\"red\"), providing meaningful labels for the x-axis and y-axis, and changing the scale of the y-axis to be between 0 and 200 (ylim=c(0,200)):\n\nplot(x=cancer$year, y=cancer$rcases, \n     type=\"l\", col = \"red\", \n     xlab = \"Year\", \n     ylab = \"Age-standardised rate (per 100,000)\", ylim=c(0,200))\n\n\n\n\nWe can now add a second line to the plot using the lines() function, specifying a dashed line (lty=2), and add a legend to the plot:\n\nplot(x=cancer$year, y=cancer$rcases, type=\"l\", col = \"red\", \n     xlab = \"Year\", ylab = \"Age-standardised rate (per 100,000)\", \n     ylim=c(0,200))\n\nlines(cancer$year, cancer$rdeaths, col = \"blue\", type = \"l\", lty = 2)\n\nlegend(\"topleft\", legend=c(\"Incidence\", \"Deaths\"), \n       col=c(\"red\", \"blue\"), lty = 1:2)\n\n\n\n\nNote: coding for graphs is not always straightforward.

    "section": "2.2 Probability",
    "text": "2.2 Probability\nProbability is defined as:\n\nthe chance of an event occurring, where an event is the result of an observation or experiment, or the description of some potential outcome.\n\nProbabilities range from 0 (where the event will never occur) to 1 (where the event will always occur). For example, tossing a coin is an experiment; one event is the coin landing with head up, while the other event is the coin landing tails up. The set of all possible outcomes in an experiment is called the sample space. For example, by tossing a coin you can get either a head or a tail (called mutually exclusive events); and by rolling a die you can get any of the six sides. Thus, for a die the sampling space is: S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nWith a fair (unbiased) die, the probability of each outcome occurring is 1/6 and its probability distribution is simply a probability of 1/6 for each of the six numbers on a die.\n\n2.2.1 Additive law of probability\nHow do we work out the probability that one roll of a die will turn out to be a 3 or a 6? To do that, we first need to work out whether the events (3 or 6 on the roll of a die) are mutually exclusive. Events are mutually exclusive if they are events which cannot occur at the same time. For example, rolling a die once and getting a 3 and 6 are mutually exclusive events (you can roll one or the other but not both in a single roll).\nTo obtain the probability of one or the other of two mutually exclusive events occurring, the sum of the probabilities of each is taken. For example, the probability of the roll of a die being a 3 or a 6 is the sum of the probability of the die being 3 (i.e. 1/6) and the probability of the die being 6 (also 1/6). With a fair die:\nProbability of a die roll being 3 or 6 = \\(1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3\\)\nAnother way of putting it is:\nP(die roll =3 or die roll =6) = P(die roll=3) + P(die roll=6) = \\(1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3\\)\n\nExample: Additive law for mutually exclusive events\nConsider that blood type can be organised into the ABO system (blood types A, B, AB or O) An individual may only have one blood type.\nUsing the information from https://www.donateblood.com.au/learn/about-blood let’s consider the ABO blood type system. The frequency distribution (prevalence) of the ABO blood type system in the population represents the probability of each of the outcomes. If we consider all possible blood type outcomes, then the total of the probabilities will sum to 1 (100%).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1:  Frequency of blood types \n\nBlood Type% of populationProbability   \n\nA38%0.38\n\nB10%0.1 \n\nAB3%0.03\n\nO49%0.49\n\nTotal100%1   \n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example we consider: What is the probability that an individual will have either blood group O or A?\nSince blood type is mutually exclusive, the probability that either one or the other occurs is the sum of the individual probabilities. These are mutually exclusive events so we can say P(O or A) = P(O) + P(A)\nThus, the answer is: P(Blood type O) + P(Blood type A) = 0.49 + 0.38 = 0.87\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Multiplicative law of probability\nThe additive law of probability lets us consider the probability of different outcomes in a single experiment. The multiplicative law lets us consider the probability of multiple events occurring in a particular order. For example: if I roll a die twice, what is the probability of rolling a 3 and then a 6?\nThese events are independent: the probability of rolling a 6 on the second roll is not affected by the first roll.\nThe multiplicative law of probability states:\n\nIf A and B are independent, then P(A and B) = P(A) \\(\\times\\) P(B).\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 3 and then a 6 is: P(3 and 6) = \\(1/6 \\times 1/6 = 1/36\\).\nNote here that the order matters – we are considering the probability of rolling a 3 and then a 6, not the probability of rolling a 6 and then a 3."

This seems trivial for the coin-toss and die-roll examples above. However, we can consider more complex events, as below.\nTo understand the behaviour of a sample statistic.

    "text": "2.4 Discrete random variables and their probability distributions\nRather than thinking of random events, we often use the term random variable to describe a quantity that can have different values determined by chance.\nA discrete random variable is a random variable that can take on only countable values (that is, non-negative whole numbers). An example of a discrete random variable is the number of heads observed in a series of coin tosses.\nA discrete random variable can be summarised by listing all the possible values that the variable can take. As defined earlier, a table, formula or graph that presents these possible values, and their associated probabilities, is called a probability distribution.\nExample: let’s consider the number of heads in a series of three coin tosses. We might observe 0 heads, or 1 head, or 2, or 3 heads. If we let X denote the number of heads in a series of three coin tosses, then possible values of X are 0, 1, 2 or 3.\nWe write the probability of observing x heads as P(X=x). So P(X=0) is the probability that the three tosses has no heads. Similarly, P(X=1) is the probability of observing one head.\nThe possible combinations for three coin tosses are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.4:  The number of heads from three coin tosses \n\nPatternNumber of heads\n\nTail, Tail, Tail0\n\nHead, Tail, Tail\n\nTail, Head, Tail1\n\nTail, Tail, Head\n\nHead, Head, Tail\n\nHead, Tail, Head2\n\nTail, Head, Head\n\nHead, Head, Head3\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are eight possible outcomes from three coin tosses (permutations). If we assume an equal chance of observing a head or a tail, each permutation above is equally likely, and so has a probability of 1/8.\nIf we consider the possibility of observing just one head out of the three tosses, this can happen in three ways (HTT, THT, TTH). So the probability of observing one head is calculated using the additive law: P(X=1) = \\(\\tfrac{1}{8} + \\tfrac{1}{8} + \\tfrac{1}{8} = \\tfrac{3}{8}\\).\nTherefore, the probability distribution for X, the number of heads from three coin tosses, is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.5:  Probability distribution for the number of heads from three coin\ntosses \n\nx (number of heads observed)P(X=x)\n\n01/8\n\n11/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 3/8\n\n21/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 3/8\n\n31/8\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the probabilities sum to 1.\nThe above example was based on a coin toss, where flipping a head or a tail is equally likely (both have probabilities of 0.5). Let’s consider a case where the probability of an event is not equal to 0.5: having blood type A.\nFrom Table 2.1, the probability that a person has Type A blood is 0.38, and therefore, the probability that a person does not have Type A blood is 0.62 (1–0.38). If we considered taking a random sample of three people, the probability that all three would have Type A blood is 0.38 × 0.38 × 0.38 (using the multiplicative rule above) – and there is only one way this could happen.\nThe number of ways two people out of three could have Type A blood is 3, and each permutation is listed in Table 2.6. The probability of observing each of the three patterns is the same, and can be calculated using the multiplicative rule: 0.38 × 0.38 × 0.62 = 0.0895.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.6:  Combinations and probabilities of Type A blood in three people \n\nPerson 1Person 2Person 3Probability\n\nAAA0.38 × 0.38 × 0.38 = 0.0549\n\nAANot A0.38 × 0.38 × 0.62 = 0.0895\n\nANot AA0.38 × 0.62 × 0.38 = 0.0895\n\nNot AAA0.62 × 0.38 × 0.38 = 0.0895\n\nANot ANot A0.38 × 0.62 × 0.62 = 0.1461\n\nNot AANot A0.62 × 0.38 × 0.62 = 0.1461\n\nNot ANot AA0.62 × 0.62 × 0.38 = 0.1461\n\nNot ANot ANot A0.62 × 0.62 × 0.62 = 0.2383\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.7 gives the probability of each of the blood type combinations we could observe in three people.

    "text": "2.5 Binomial distribution\nThe above are examples of the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution is used when we have a collection of random events, where each random event is binary (e.g. Heads vs Tails, Type A blood vs Not Type A blood, Infected vs Not infected). The binomial distribution calculates (in general terms):\n\nthe probability of observing k successes\nfrom a collection of n trials\nwhere the probability of a success in one trial is p.\n\nThe terms used here can be defined as:\n\na success is simply an event of interest from a binary random event. In the coin-toss example, “success” was tossing a Head. In the blood type example, we were only interested in whether someone was Type A or not Type A, so “success” was a blood of Type A. We tend to use the word “success” to mean “an event of interest”, and “failure” as “an event not of interest”.\nthe number of trials refers to the number of random events observed. In both examples, we observed three events (three coin tosses, three people).\nthe probability of a success (p) simply refers to the probability of the event of interest. In the coin toss example, this was the probability of tossing a Heads (=0.5); for the blood-type example, this was the probability of having Type A blood (0.38).\n\nPutting all this together, we say that we have a binomial experiment. To satisfy the assumptions of a binomial distribution, our experiment must satisfy the following criteria:\n\nThe experiment consists of fixed number (n) of trials.\nThe result of each trial falls into only one of two categories – the event occurred (“success”) or the event did not occur (“failure”).\nThe probability, p, of the event occurring remains constant for each trial.\nEach trial of the experiment is independent of the other trials.\n\nWe have shown in the examples above how we can calculate the probabilities for small experiments (n=3). Once n becomes large, constructing such probability distribution tables becomes difficult. The general formula for calculating the probability of observing k successes from n trials, where each trial has a probability of success of p is given by:\n\\[ P(X=k) = \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} \\times p^k \\times (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\nwhere \\(n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\dots \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\nNote that this formula is almost never calculated by hand. Instructions for calculating binomial probabilities are given in the Stata and R notes at the end of this Module.\n\n2.5.1 Mean and variance of a binomial variable\nThe properties of the binomial distribution are useful in the statistical modelling of prevalence data. If X has a binomial distribution, then the mean of X is:\n\\[ E(X) = n \\times p\\] and the variance is:\n\\[ var(X) = n \\times p \\times (1-p) \\] where n = the number of trials, and p = the probability of the event occurring (or success).\n\nWorked example\nA population-based survey conducted by the AIHW (2008) of a random sample of the Australian population estimated that in 2007, 19.8% of the Australian population were current smokers.\n\nFrom a random sample of 6 people from the Australian population in 2007, what is the probability that 3 of them will be smokers?\nWhat is the probability that among the six persons, at least 4 will be smokers?\nWhat is the probability that at most, 2 will be smokers?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nCalculating this single binomial probability is best done using software.\n\nIn Stata, we used the binomialp function with n=6, k=3, and p=0.198. This gives an answer of 0.08 (see Section 2.19 for details).\nIn R, we used the dbinom function with x=3, size=6, and prob=0.198. This gives an answer of 0.08 (see Section 2.29 for details).\n\nIn common language, getting “at least 4” smokers means getting 4, 5 or 6 smokers. Since these are mutually exclusive events, we can apply the additive law to find the probability of getting at least 4 smokers:\n\n\\[ P(X \\ge 4) = P(X=4) + P(X=5) + P(X=6) \\] Using the same binomial probability functions as in the previous question, we could calculate\n\nP(X=4) = 0.0148\nP(X=5) = 0.00146\nP(X=6) = 0.0000603\n\nAnswer: \\(P(X \\ge 4) = 0.0148 + 0.00146 + 0.0000603 = 0.016\\)\nAlternatively, in Stata we can use the binomialtail function (which gives “the probability of observing k or more successes in n trials when the probability of a success on one trial is p”). Again, see Section 2.19 for details.\nIn R we can use the pbinom function with the lower.tail=FALSE option (Section 2.29).\n\nObserving at most two means observing 0, 1 or 2 smokers. Therefore, the probability of observing at most 2 smokers is:\n\n\nP(X \\(\\le\\) 2) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2)\nP(X=0) = 0.266\nP(X=1) = 0.394\nP(X=2) = 0.243\n\nAnswer: P(X \\(\\le\\) 2) = 0.266+0.394+0.243=0.903\nThis can also be done by using the binomial function in Stata (which gives “the probability of observing k or fewer successes in n trials when the probability of a success on one trial is p”) or the pbinom function in R."

It is characterised by its bell-shaped, symmetric curve and its tails that approach zero on either side.\nThere are two reasons for the importance of the Normal distribution in biostatistics (Kirkwood and Sterne, 2003). The first is that many variables can be modelled reasonably well using the Normal distribution. Even if the observed data were not Normally distributed, it can often be made reasonably Normal after applying some transformation of the data. The second (and possible most important) reason, is based on the central limit theorem and will be discussed in Module 3.\nThe Normal distribution is characterised by two parameters: the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)). The mean defines where the middle of the Normal distribution is located, and the standard deviation defines how wide the tails of the distribution are.\nFor a Normal distribution, about 68% of the observations lie between \\(- \\sigma\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) of the mean; 95% of the observations lie between \\(−1.96 \\times \\sigma\\) and \\(1.96 \\times \\sigma\\) from the mean; and almost all the observations (99.7%) lie between \\(-3 \\times \\sigma\\) and \\(3 \\times \\sigma\\) (Figure 2.3).

However, every Normal distribution can be transformed to what we call the Standard Normal distribution, which has a mean of zero (\\(\\mu = 0\\)) and a standard deviation of one (\\(\\sigma = 1\\)). The Standard Normal distribution is so important that it has been assigned its own symbol: Z.\nEvery observation from a Normal distribution \\(X\\) with a mean \\(\\mu\\) and a standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) can be transformed to a z-score (also called a Standard Normal deviate) by the formula:\n\\[ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\nThe z-score is simply how far an observation lies from the population mean value, scaled by the population standard deviation.\nWe can use z-scores to estimate probabilities, as shown in Worked Example 2.2.\n\nWorked Example\nThis example extends the example of diastolic blood pressure shown in Figure 2.1. Assume that the mean diastolic blood pressure for men is 77.9 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 11. What is the probability that a man selected at random will have high blood pressure (i.e. diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90)?\nTo estimate the probability that diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 (i.e. the upper tail probability), we first need to calculate the z-score that corresponds to 90 mmHg.\nUsing the z-score formula, with x=90, \\(\\mu\\)=77.9 and \\(\\sigma\\)=11:\n\\[ z = \\frac{90 - 77.9}{11} = 1.1 \\] Thus, a blood pressure of 90 mmHg corresponds to a z-score of 1.1, or a value 1.1 \\(\\times \\sigma\\) above the mean weight of the population.\nFigure 2.4 shows the probability of a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more in the population for a z-score of greater than 1.1 on a Standard Normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Area under the Standard Normal curve (as probability) for Z &gt; 1.1\n\n\n\n\nUsing software, we find the probability that a person has a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more as P(Z ≥ 1.1) = 0.136 (see Section 2.20 and Section 2.30 for details).\nApart from calculating probabilities, z-scores are most useful for comparing measurements taken from a sample to a known population distribution. It allows measurements to be compared to one another despite being on different scales or having different predicted values.\nFor example, if we take a sample of children and measure their weights, it is useful to describe those weights as z-scores from the population weight distribution for each age and gender. Such distributions from large population samples are widely available. This allows us to describe a child’s weight in terms of how much it is above or below the population average. For example, if mean weights were compared, children aged 5 years would be on average heavier than the children aged 3 years simply because they are older and therefore larger. To make a valid comparison, we could use the Z-scores to say that children aged 3 years tend to be more overweight than children aged 5 years because they have a higher mean z-score for weight."

    "text": "2.9 Assessing Normality\nThere are several ways to assess whether a continuous variable is Normally distributed. With a large sample, simply plotting a histogram is one of the best ways to assess whether a variable is Normally distributed. For smaller samples, examining a histogram can be less clear, particularly for histograms with only a small number of bins. However, if a histogram looks bell-shaped and approximately symmetrical, assuming Normality would be reasonable.\nIt may be useful to examine a boxplot of a variable in conjunction with a histogram. However a boxplot in isolation is not as useful as a histogram, as a boxplot only indicates whether a variable is distributed symmetrically (indicated by equal “whiskers”). A boxplot cannot give an indication of whether the distribution is bell-shaped, or flat.\n\nFor your information: There are formal tests in Stata and R that test for Normality. These tests are beyond the scope of this course and are not recommended.\n\nThe histogram for our 30 weights is approximately bell-shaped and roughly symmetrical. The mean and median (50th percentile) values are similar, as would be expected for a Normal distribution. Thus, it would be reasonable to assume that the data are Normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Histogram and boxplot of weight of 30 students attending a gym"

    "section": "2.10 Non-Normally distributed measurements",
    "text": "2.10 Non-Normally distributed measurements\nIn the above example, diastolic blood pressure was Normally distributed with an approximately bell-shaped frequency histogram. However, not all measurements are Normally distributed, and the symmetry of the bell shape may be distorted by the presence of some very small or very large values. Non-Normal distributions such as this are called skewed distributions.\nWhen there are some very large values, the distribution is said to be positively skewed.This often occurs when measuring variables related to time, such as days of hospital stay, where most patients have short stays (say 1 - 5 days) but a few patients with serious medical conditions have very long lengths of hospital stay (say 20 - 100 days).\nIn practice, most parametric summary statistics are quite robust to minor deviations from Normality and non-parametric statistical methods are only required when the sample size is small and/or the data are obviously skewed with some influential outliers.\nWhen the data are markedly skewed, histograms and boxplots can look very different. For example, data of length of hospital stay in a sample of children are shown as a histogram and as a box plot in Figure 2.6.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Histogram and boxplot of length of stay\n\n\n\n\nIn the histogram of Figure 2.6, there is a tail of values to the right, so we would conclude that the distribution is skewed to the right. In the boxplot, the whiskers appear to be fairly symmetric, but there are some unusual values (denoted by dots) above the box and its whiskers. Stata defines these unusual values as being more than 1.5 times the IQR from the edge of the box.\nThe presence of unusual values may be an indication that the data are not Normally distributed. Both the histogram and the box plot show that the distribution has a marked tail towards high values and that non-parametric statistics should be used to generate summary statistics and analyse the data.\nNote that Stata has defined points as being unusual, or outliers. Outliers can be problematic and the decision to include them or omit them from further analyses can be difficult. After detecting any outliers or extreme values, you should not automatically exclude them from the analysis, particularly if the sample was selected randomly from a population. First, it is important to check the original data collection form or questionnaire to rule out the possibility of a data entry error. If the outlier is not a data entry error, it is then important to decide whether the observation is biologically plausible and, if it is, it should be included in the analysis.\n\n2.10.1 Which measure of central tendency to use\nIt is most appropriate to use the mean when the data exhibit a symmetric or bell-shaped distribution. For skewed distributions (where there are more values on the higher (negative skew) or lower side (positive skew) of the scale) the mean is not a good measure of the centre, as the calculation will be influenced by the extreme values. The median is the preferred statistic for describing central tendency in a skewed distribution.\nIf the data exhibits a Normal distribution, we use the standard deviation as the measure of spread. Otherwise, the interquartile range is preferred."

Many methods of statistical inferences based on theoretical sampling properties that are derived from a Normal distribution with the characteristics described above. Thus, it is important that measurements approximate to a Normal distribution before these parametric methods are used. The methods are called ‘parametric’ because they are based on the parameters – the mean and standard deviation - that underlie a Normal distribution. Statistics which do not assume a particular distribution are called distribution-free statistics, or ‘non-parametric statistics’.\nIn this course, you will learn about both parametric and non-parametric statistical methods. Parametric summary statistical methods include those based on the mean, standard deviation and range (Module 1), and standard error and 95% confidence interval (Module 3). Parametric statistical tests also include t-tests which will be covered in Modules 4 and 5, and correlation and regression described in Module 8.\nNon-parametric summary statistical methods are often based on ranks, and may use such statistics as the median, mode and inter-quartile range (Module 1). Non-parametric statistical tests that use ranking are described in Module 9."

    "text": "2.12 Other types of probability distributions\nIn this module we have considered a Normal probability distribution and how to use it to measure the precision of continuously distributed measurements. Data also follow other types of distributions which are briefly described below. In other modules in this course, we will be looking at a range of methods to analyse health data and will refer back to these different distributions.\nNormal approximation of binomial: When the sample size becomes large, it becomes cumbersome to calculate the exact probability of an event using the binomial distribution. Conveniently, with large sample sizes, the binomial distribution approximates a Normal distribution. The mean and SD of a binomial distribution can be used to calculate the probability of the event as though it was from a Normal distribution.\nPoisson distribution: is another distribution which is often used in health research for modelling count data. The Poisson distribution is followed when a number of events happen in a fixed time interval. This distribution is useful for describing data such as deaths in the population in a time period. For example, the number of deaths from breast cancer in one year in women over 50 years old will be an observation from a Poisson distribution. We can also use this to make comparisons of mortality rates between populations.\nMany other probability distributions can be derived for functions which arise in statistical analyses but the chi-squared, t and F distributions are the three distributions that are most widely used. These have many applications, some of which are described in later modules.\nThe chi-squared distribution is a skewed distribution which allows us to determine the probability of a deviation between a count that we observe and a count that we expect for categorical data. One use of this is in conducting statistical tests for categorical data. See Module 7.\nA t-distribution is used when the population standard deviation is not known. The t-distribution is appropriate for small samples (&lt;30) and its distribution is bell shaped similar to a Normal distribution but slightly flatter. The t-distribution is useful for comparing mean values. See Module 4 and Module 5."

In this section, we will demonstrate how to import data from other packages into Stata using commands in the File &gt; Import menu.\n\n2.13.1 Importing plain text data into Stata\nA csv file, or a “comma separated variables” file is commonly used to store data. These files have a very simple structure: they are plain text files, where data are separated by commas. csv files have the advantage that, as they are plain text files, they can be opened by a large number of programs (such as Notepad in Windows, TextEdit in MacOS, Microsoft Excel - even Microsoft Word). While they can be opened by Microsoft Excel, they can be opened by many other programs: the csv file can be thought of as the lingua-franca of data.\nIn this demonstration, we will use data on the weight of 1000 people entered in a csv file called mod02_weight_1000.csv available on Moodle. To confirm that the file is readable by any text editor, here are the first ten lines of the file, opened in Notepad on Microsoft Windows, and TextEdit on MacOS.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo import it into Stata, use File &gt; Import &gt; Text data (delimited, .csv, …) to bring up the import delimited text data dialog box.

    "text": "2.14 Checking your data for errors in Stata\nBefore you start describing and analysing your data, it is important to make sure that no errors have been made during the data entry process. Basically, you are looking for values that are outside the range of possible or plausible values for that variable.\nIf an error is found, the best method for correcting the error is to go back to the original data e.g. the hard copy questionnaire, to obtain the original value, entering the correct value into Stata. If the original data is not available or the original data is also incorrect, the erroneous value is often excluded from the dataset.\nFor continuous variables, the easiest methods are to examine a boxplot and histogram. For example, a boxplot and histogram for the weight variable we just imported appear as:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear outlying point shown in the boxplot. Although not obvious, the same point is shown in the histogram as a bar around 700 with a very short height.\nTo identify the outlying observation in the dataset, we can sort your data in ascending order and check the minimum and maximum values in the Data Editor. You will need to decide if these values are a data entry error or are biologically plausible. If an extreme value or “outlier”, is biologically plausible, it should be included in all analyses.\nTo sort data, you must be in the Data Editor (Edit) window. Select Data &gt; Sort data… and choose weight as shown in the sort dialog box below. Click OK to do an ascending sort (arranging weight from smallest to largest). [Command: sort weight]\n\n\n\n\n\nBy scrolling through the data, you will see that the values range from 53.8kg to 85.8kg with a very high value of 700.2kg. A value as high as 700kg is likely to be a data entry error (e.g. error in entering an extra zero) and is not a plausible weight value. Here, you should check your original data. You might find that the original weight was recorded as 70.2kg. You can change this in Stata by deleting a zero from cell with 700.2 in the Data Editor (Edit) window.\nNote: if an extreme value lies within the range of biological plausibility it should not be removed from analysis.\nOnce you have checked your data for errors, you are ready to start analysing your data."

    "text": "2.21 Importing data into R\nWe have described previously how to import data that have been saved as R .rds files. It is quite common to have data saved in other file types, such as Microsoft Excel, or plain text files. In this section, we will demonstrate how to import data from other packages into R.\nThere are two useful packages for importing data into R: haven (for data that have been saved by Stata, SAS or SPSS) and readxl (for data saved by Microsoft Excel). Additionally, the labelled package is useful in working with data that have been labelled in Stata.\n\n2.21.1 Importing plain text data into R\nA csv file, or a “comma separated variables” file is commonly used to store data. These files have a very simple structure: they are plain text files, where data are separated by commas. csv files have the advantage that, as they are plain text files, they can be opened by a large number of programs (such as Notepad in Windows, TextEdit in MacOS, Microsoft Excel - even Microsoft Word). While they can be opened by Microsoft Excel, they can be opened by many other programs: the csv file can be thought of as the lingua-franca of data.\nIn this demonstration, we will use data on the weight of 1000 people entered in a csv file called mod02_weight_1000.csv available on Moodle.\nTo confirm that the file is readable by any text editor, here are the first ten lines of the file, opened in Notepad on Microsoft Windows, and TextEdit on MacOS.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the read.csv function:\n\nsample &lt;- read.csv(\"data/examples/mod02_weight_1000.csv\")\n\nHere, the read.csv function has the default that the first row of the dataset contains the variable names. If your data do not have column names, you can use header=FALSE in the function.\nNote: there is an alternative function read_csv which is part of the readr package (a component of the tidyverse). Some would argue that the read_csv function is more appropriate to use because of an issue known as strings.as.factors. The strings.as.factors default was removed in R Version 4.0.0, so it is less important which of the two functions you use to import a .csv file. More information about this issue can be found here and here."

    "section": "2.22 Checking your data for errors in R",
    "text": "2.22 Checking your data for errors in R\nBefore you start describing and analysing your data, it is important to make sure that no errors have been made during the data entry process. Basically, you are looking for values that are outside the range of possible or plausible values for that variable.\nIf an error is found, the best method for correcting the error is to go back to the original data e.g. the hard copy questionnaire, to obtain the original value, entering the correct value into R If the original data is not available or the original data is also incorrect, the erroneous value is often excluded from the dataset.\nFor continuous variables, the easiest methods are to examine a boxplot and histogram. For example, a boxplot and histogram for the weight variable we just imported appear as:\n\nhist(sample$weight, xlab=\"Weight (kg)\", main=\"Histogram of 1000 weights\")\n\n\n\nboxplot(sample$weight, xlab=\"Weight (kg)\", main=\"Boxplot of 1000 weights\")\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear outlying point shown in the boxplot. Although not obvious, the same point is shown in the histogram as a bar around 700 with a very short height.\nWe can identify any outlying observations in the dataset using the subset function. You will need to decide if these values are a data entry error or are biologically plausible. If an extreme value or “outlier”, is biologically plausible, it should be included in all analyses.\nFor example, to list any observations from the sample dataset with a weight larger than 200:\n\nsubset(sample, weight&gt;200)\n\n\n\n\nidweight\n\n58700\n\n\n\n\nWe see that there is a very high value of 700.2kg. A value as high as 700kg is likely to be a data entry error (e.g. error in entering an extra zero) and is not a plausible weight value. Here, you should check your original data.\nYou might find that the original weight was recorded in medical records as 70.2kg. You can change this in R by writing code.\nNote: many statistical packages will allow you to view a spreadsheet version of your data and edit values in that spreadsheet. This is not best practice, as corrected observations may revert to their original values depending on whether the edited data have been saved or not. By using code-based recoding, the changes will be reproduced the next time the code is run.\nWe will use an ifelse statement to recode the incorrect weight of 700.2kg into 70.2kg. The form of the ifelse statement is as follows:\nifelse(test, value_if_true, value_if_false)\nOur code will create a new column (called weight_clean) in the sample dataframe. We will test whether weight is equal to 700.2; if this is true, we will assign weight_clean to be 70.2, otherwise weight_clean will equal the value of weight.\nPutting it all together:\n\nsample$weight_clean = ifelse(sample$weight==700.2, 70.2, sample$weight)\n\nNote: if an extreme value lies within the range of biological plausibility it should not be removed from analysis.\nOnce you have checked your data for errors, you are ready to start analysing your data.\n\n2.22.1 What on earth: == ?\nIn R, the test of equality is denoted by two equal signs: ==. So we would use == to test whether an observation is equal to a certain value. Let’s see an example:\n\n# Test whether 6 is equal to 6\n6 == 6\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Test whether 6 is equal to 42\n6 == 42\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nYou can read the == as “is equal to”. So the code sample$weight == 700.2 is read as: “is the value of weight from the data frame sample equal to 700.2?”. In our ifelse statement above, if this condition is true, we replace weight by 70.2; if it is false, we leave weight as is."

We first begin by creating two new data frames, for males and females separately, using the subset() function:\n\nsurvey_males &lt;- subset(survey, sex==\"Male\")\nsurvey_females &lt;- subset(survey, sex==\"Female\")\n\nNote that we use the label for sex, not the underlying numeric value, as sex is a factor.\nWe can now create hisotgrams and boxplots of BMI for males and females separately. To place the graphs next to each other in a single figure, we can use the par function, which sets the graphics parameters. Essentially, we want to tell R to split a plot window into a matrix with nr rows and nc columns, and we fill the cells by rows (mfrow) or columns (mfcols).\nFor example, to plot four figures in a single plot, filled by rows, we use par(mfrow=c(2,2)).\nWhen we are done plotting multiple graphs, we can reset the graphics parameters by submitting par(mfrow=c(1,1)).\n\n# Set the graphics parameters to plot 2 rows and 2 columns:\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\n\n# Specify each plot separately\nhist(survey_males$bmi, xlab=\"BMI (kg/m2)\", main=\"Males\")\nhist(survey_females$bmi, xlab=\"BMI (kg/m2)\", main=\"Females\")\n\nboxplot(survey_males$bmi, ylab=\"BMI (kg/m2)\", main=\"Males\")\nboxplot(survey_females$bmi, ylab=\"BMI (kg/m2)\", main=\"Females\")\n\n\n\n# Reset graphics parameters\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))"

For example, we might want to group some categories of a categorical variable, or to present a continuous variable in a categorical way.\nIn this example, we can recode BMI into the following categories as suggested by the World Health Organisation [footnote]:\n\nUnderweight: BMI &lt; 18.5\nNormal weight: 18.5 \\(\\le\\) BMI &lt; 25\nPre-obesity: 25 \\(\\le\\) BMI &lt; 30\nObesity Class I: 30 \\(\\le\\) BMI &lt; 35\nObesity Class II: 35 \\(\\le\\) BMI &lt; 40\nObesity Class III: BMI \\(\\ge\\) 40\n\nThe quickest way to recode a continuous variable into categories is to use the cut command which takes a continuous variable, and “cuts” it into groups based on the specified “cutpoints”\n\nsurvey$bmi_cat &lt;- cut(survey$bmi, \n                      breaks = c(0, 18.5, 25, 30, 35, 40, 100))\n\nNotice that lower (BMI=0) and upper (BMI=100) bounds have been specified, as both a lower and upper limit must be defined for each group.\nIf we examine the new bmi_cat variable:\n\nsummary(survey$bmi_cat)\n\n (0,18.5] (18.5,25]   (25,30]   (30,35]   (35,40]  (40,100] \n       18       362       411       205        97        47 \n\n\nwe see that each group has been labelled (a, b].

    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nTo describe the characteristics of a population we can gather data about the entire population (as is undertaken in a national census) or we can gather data from a sample of the population. When undertaking a research study, taking a sample from a population is far more cost-effective and less time consuming than collecting information from the entire population. When a sample of a population is selected, summary statistics that describe the sample are used to make inferences about the total population from which the sample was drawn. These are referred to as inferential statistics.\nHowever, for the inferences about the population to be valid, a random sample of the population must be obtained. The goal of using random sampling methods is to obtain a sample that is representative of the target population. In other words, apart from random error, the information derived from the sample is expected to be much the same as the information collected from a complete population census as long as the sample is large enough."

    "text": "3.2 Sampling methods\nMethods have been designed to select participants from a population such that each person in the target population has an equal probability of being chosen. Methods that use this approach are called random sampling methods. Examples include simple random sampling and stratified random sampling.\nIn simple random sampling, every person in the population from which the sample is drawn has the same random chance of being selected into the sample. To implement this method, every person in the population is allocated an ID number and then a random sample of the ID numbers is selected. Software packages can be used to generate a list of random numbers to select the random sample.\nIn stratified sampling, the population is divided into distinct non-overlapping subgroups (strata) according to an important characteristic (e.g. age or sex) and then a random sample is selected from each of the strata. This method is used to ensure that sufficient numbers of people are sampled from each stratum and therefore each subgroup of interest is adequately represented in the sample.\nThe purpose of using random sampling is to minimise selection bias to ensure that the sample enrolled in a study is representative of the population being studied. This is important because the summary statistics that are obtained can then be regarded as valid in that they can be applied (generalised) back to the population.\nA non-representative sample might occur when random sampling is used, simply by chance. However, non-random sampling methods, such as using a study population that does not represent the whole population, will often result in a non-representative sample being selected so that the summary statistics from the sample cannot be generalised back to the population from which the participants were drawn. The effects of non-random error are much more serious than the effects of random error. Concepts such as non-random error (i.e. systematic bias), selection bias, validity and generalisability are discussed in more detail in PHCM9796: Foundations of Epidemiology."

    "section": "3.3 Standard error and precision",
    "text": "3.3 Standard error and precision\nModule 1 introduced the mean, variance and standard deviation as measures of central tendency and spread for continuous measurements from a sample or a population. As described in Module 1, we rarely have data on the entire population but we can infer information about the population (e.g. the mean weight of people in the population) based on a sample. However, a sample taken from a population is usually a small proportion of the total population. If the sample is very small, we would not expect our estimate of the population mean value to be precise. If the sample is very large, we would expect a more precise estimate of the population mean, i.e. the estimated mean value would be much closer to the true mean value in the population.\n\n3.3.1 The standard error of the mean\nA point estimate is a single best guess of the true value in the population. Instead of trying to guess the true value, it may be preferable to give a range of values in which we think the true value lies. For example, suppose we want to estimate the average weight of a population, and found a sample mean of 65 kg. Rather than saying we believe the true mean to be 65 kg, we could say we believe it is somewhere between, say, 58 kg and 72 kg.\nOften in papers, one will see something like “the mean is 70.24 \\(\\pm\\) 1.78 kg”. The value 1.78 is the standard error of the mean (sometimes shortened to S.E.M. or S.E.). The standard error of the mean measures the extent to which we expect the means from different samples to vary because of chance error in the sampling process. The standard error is a measure of precision of the point estimate. This statistic is directly proportional to the standard deviation of the variable, and inversely proportional to the size of the sample. The standard error of the mean for a continuously distributed measurement for which the SD is an accurate measure of spread is computed as follows:\n\\[ \\text{SE}(\\bar{x}) = \\frac{\\text{SD}}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] For our sample of weight data from 30 patients in Module 1:\n\\[ \\text{SE}(\\bar{x}) = \\frac{\\text{5.04}}{\\sqrt{30}} = 0.92 \\] Because the calculation uses the sample size (n) (i.e. the number of study participants) in the denominator, the SE will become smaller when the sample size becomes larger. A smaller SE indicates that the estimated mean value is more precise.\nThe standard error is an important statistic that is related to sampling variation. When a random sample of a population is selected, it is likely to differ in some characteristic compared with another random sample selected from the same population. Also, when a sample of a population is taken, the true population mean is an unknown value.\nJust as the standard deviation measures the spread of the data around the population mean, the standard error of the mean measures the spread of the sample means. Note that we do not have different samples, only one. It is a theoretical concept which enables us to conduct various other statistical analyses."

    "text": "3.5 95% confidence interval of the mean\nIn Module 2, we showed that the characteristics of a Standard Normal Distribution are that 95% of the data lie within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean (Figure 2.2). Because the central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately Normal in large enough samples, we expect that 95% of the mean values would fall within 1.96 × SE units above and below the measured mean population value.\nFor example, if we repeated the study on weight 100 times using 100 different random samples from the population and calculated the mean weight for each of the 100 samples, approximately 95% of the values for the mean weight calculated for each of the 100 samples would fall within 1.96 × SE of the population mean weight.\nThis interpretation of the SE is translated into the concept of precision as a 95% confidence interval (CI). A 95% CI is a range of values within which we have 95% confidence that the true population mean lies. If an experiment was conducted a very large number of times, and a 95%CI was calculated for each experiment, 95% of the confidence intervals would contain the true population mean.\nThe calculation of the 95% CI for a mean is as follows:\n\\[  \\bar{x} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{SE}( \\bar{x} ) \\] This is the generic formula for calculating 95% CI for any summary statistic. In general, the mean value can be replaced by the point estimate of a rate or a proportion and the same formula applies for computing 95% CIs, i.e.\n\\[ 95\\% \\text{ CI} = \\text{point estimate} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(\\text{point estimate)} \\]\nThe main difference in the methods used to calculate the 95% CI for different point estimates is the way the SE is calculated. The methods for calculating 95% CI around proportions and other ratio measures will be discussed in Module 6.\nThe use of 1.96 as a general critical value to compute the 95% CI is determined by sampling theory. For the confidence interval of the mean, the critical value (1.96) is based on normal distribution (true when the population SD is known). However, in practice, Stata and other statistical packages will provide slightly different confidence intervals because they use a critical value obtained from the t-distribution. The t-distribution approaches a normal distribution when the sample size approaches infinity, and is close to a normal distribution when the sample size is ≥30.The critical values obtained from the t-distribution are always larger than the corresponding critical value from the normal distribution. The difference gets smaller as the sample size becomes larger. For example, when the sample size n=10, the critical value from the t-distribution is 2.26 (rather than 1.96); when n= 30, the value is 2.05; when n=100, the value is 1.98; and when n=1000, the critical value is 1.96.\nThe critical value multiplied by SE (for normal distribution, 1.96 × SE) is called the maximum likely error for 95% confidence.\n\n3.5.1 The t-distribution and when should I use it?\nThe population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is required for calculation of the standard error. Usually, \\(\\sigma\\) is not known and the sample standard deviation (\\(s\\)) is used to estimate it. It is known, however, that the sample standard deviation of a normally distributed variable underestimates the true value of \\(\\sigma\\), particularly when the sample size is small.\nSomeone by the pseudonym of Student came up with the Student’s t distribution with (\\(n-1\\)) degrees of freedom to account for this underestimation. It looks very much like the standardised normal distribution, only that it has fatter tails (Figure 3.1). As the degrees of freedom increase (i.e. as \\(n\\) increases), the t-distribution gradually approaches the standard normal distribution. With a sufficiently large sample size, the Student’s t-distribution closely approximates the standardised normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The normal (Z) and the student’s t-distribution with 2, 5 and 30 degrees of freedom\n\n\n\n\nIf a variable \\(X\\) is normally distributed and the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is known, using the normal distribution is appropriate. However, if \\(\\sigma\\) is not known then one should use the student t-distribution with (\\(n – 1\\)) degrees of freedom.\n\n\n3.5.2 Worked Example 3.1: 95% CI of a mean using individual data\nUsing our sample of 30 weights, we calculated the mean weight to be 70.0kg, with a standard error of 0.92 (Section 3.3.1). As we have estimated the standard deviation for this sample, we cannot use 1.96 to calculate the confidence interval for the mean. Instead, we use Stata or R to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean. In this example, the 95% confidence interval for the mean is calculated as 68.1kg to 71.9kg (see software section for details).\nWe interpret this confidence interval as: we are 95% confident that the true mean of the population from which our sample was drawn lies between 68.1 kg and 71.9 kg.\nThis calculation takes into account both the sample mean of 70.0 kg and the sampling error that has arisen by chance due to the sample size of 30 people. For a 95% CI to be reported around a mean value, the data values need to be approximately normally distributed, as discussed in Module 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\n\nIf we were calculating this confidence interval by hand, we note that the standard deviation we estimate is not the population standard deviation, but is estimated from a sample. Therefore we cannot use the value of 1.96 when calculating the 95% confidence interval. Instead, we use the critical t-value, which for 29 degrees of freedom is 2.045:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ 95\\% \\text{ CI}(\\bar{x}) &=  \\bar{x} \\pm 2.045 \\times \\text{SE}(\\bar{x}) \\\\\n&= 70.0 \\pm 2.045 \\times 0.92 \\\\\n&= 68.1 \\text{ to } 71.9 \\text{kg}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Worked Example 3.2: 95% CI of a mean using summarised data\nThe publication of a study using a sample of 242 participants reported a sample mean systolic blood pressure of 128.4 mmHg and a sample standard deviation of 19.56 mmHg. Find the 95% confidence interval for the mean systolic blood pressure.\nIn Stata we use the cii means command to compute the 95% confidence interval given the sample mean, sample standard deviation and the sample size (i.e. without using individual data from a dataset) (Section 3.7):\n\n. cii means 242 128.4 19.56\n\n    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std.

For example, we may want to know:\n\nwhether a safety program has been effective in reducing injuries in a factory, i.e. whether the frequency of injuries in the group who attended a safety program is lower than in the group who did not receive the safety program;\nwhether a new drug is more effective in reducing blood pressure than a conventional drug, i.e. whether the mean blood pressure in the group receiving the new drug is lower than the mean blood pressure in the group receiving the conventional medication;\nwhether an environmental exposure increases the risk of a disease, i.e. whether the frequency of disease is higher in the group who have been exposed to an environmental factor than in the non-exposed group.\n\nWe may also want to know something about a single group. For example, whether the mean blood pressure of a sample is the same as the general population.\nThese questions can be answered by setting up a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, and performing a hypothesis test (also known as a significance test)."

    "section": "4.2 Hypothesis testing",
    "text": "4.2 Hypothesis testing\nHypothesis testing is a statistical technique that is used to quantify the evidence against a null hypothesis. A null hypothesis (H0) is a statement that there is no difference in a summary statistic between groups. For example, a null hypothesis may be stated as follows:\nH0 = there is no difference in mean systolic blood pressure between a group taking a conventional drug and a group taking a newly developed drug\nWe also have an alternative hypothesis that is opposite or contrasting to the null hypothesis. In our example above, the alternative hypothesis for the above null hypothesis is that there is a difference between groups. The alternative hypothesis is usually of most interest to the researcher but in practice, formal statistical tests are used to test the null hypothesis (not the alternative hypothesis). The hypotheses are always in reference to the population from which the sample is drawn, not the sample itself.\nAfter setting up our null and alternative hypotheses, we use the data to generate a test statistic. The particular test statistic differs depending on the type of data being analysed (e.g. continuous or categorical), the study design (e.g. paired or independent) and the question being asked.\nThe test statistic is then compared to a known distribution to calculate the probability of observing a test statistic which is as large or larger than the observed test statistic, if the null hypothesis was true. The probability is known as the P-value.\nInformally, the P-value can be interpreted as the probability of observing data like ours, or more extreme, if the null hypothesis was true.\nIf the P-value is small, it is unlikely that we would observe data like ours or more extreme if the null hypothesis was true. In other words, our data are not consistent with the null hypothesis, and we conclude that we have evidence against the null hypothesis. If the P-value is not small, the probability of observing data like ours or more extreme is not unlikely. We therefore have little or no evidence against the null hypothesis. In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis cannot be proven or accepted; we can only find evidence to refute the null hypothesis.\nTo summarise:\n\na small P-value gives us evidence against the null hypothesis;\na P-value that is not small provides little or no evidence against null hypothesis;\nthe smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nHistorically, a value of 0.05 has been used as a cut-point for finding evidence against the null hypothesis. A P-value less than 0.05 would be interpreted as “statistically significant”, and would allow us to “reject the null hypothesis”. A P-value greater than 0.05 would be interpreted as “not significant”, and we would “fail to reject the null hypothesis”. This arbitrary dichotomy is overly simplistic, and a more nuanced view is now recommended. Recommended interpretations for P-values are given in Table 4.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1:  Interpretation of P-values \n\nSize of P-valueStrength of evidence\n\n&lt;0.001Very strong evidence\n\n0.001 to &lt;0.01Strong evidence\n\n0.01 to &lt;0.05Evidence\n\n0.05 to &lt;0.1Weak evidence\n\n≥0.1Little or no evidence\n\n\n\n\n\nP-values are usually generated using statistical software although other methods such as statistical tables or Excel functions can be used to generate test statistics and determine the P-value. In traditional statistics, the probability level was described as a lower-case p but in many journals today, probability is commonly described by upper case P. Both have the same meaning."

    "text": "4.3 Effect size\nIn hypothesis testing, P-values convey only part of the information about the hypothesis and need to be accompanied by an estimation of the effect size, that is, a description of the magnitude of the difference between the study groups. The effect size is a summary statistic that conveys the size of the difference between two groups. For continuous variables, it is usually calculated as the difference between two mean values.\nIf the variable is binary, the effect size can be expressed as the absolute difference between two proportions (attributable risk), or as an odds ratio or relative risk.\nReporting the effect size enables clinicians and other researchers to judge whether a statistically significant result is also a clinically important finding. The size of the difference or the risk statistic provides information to help health professionals decide whether the observed effect is large and important enough to warrant a change in current health care practice, is equivocal and suggests a need for further research, or is small and clinically unimportant."

    "text": "4.4 Statistical significance and clinical importance\nWhen applying statistical methods in health and medical research, we need to make an informed decision about whether the effect size that led to a statistically significant finding is also clinically important (see Figure 4.1)). The decision about whether a statistically significant result is also clinically important depends on expert knowledge and is best made by practitioners with experience in the field.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Statistical significance vs. clinical importance (Source: Armitage P, Berry G, Matthews JNS. (2001)\n\n\nIt is possible when conducting significance tests, particularly in very large studies, that a small effect is found to be statistically significant. For example, say in a large study of over 1000 patients, a new medication was found to lower blood pressure on average by 1 mmHg more than a currently accepted drug and this was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). However, such a small decrease in blood pressure would probably not be considered clinically important. The cost and side effects of prescribing the new medication would need to be weighed against the very small average benefit that would be expected. In this case, although the null hypothesis would be rejected (i.e. the result is statistically significant), the result would not be clinically important. This is the situation described in scenario (c) of Figure 4.1.\nConversely, it is possible to obtain a large, clinically important difference between groups, but a P value that does not demonstrate a statistically significant difference.\nFor example, consider a study to measure the rate of hospital admissions. We may find that 80% of children who present to the Emergency Department are admitted before an intervention is introduced compared to only 65% of children after the intervention. However, the P value may be calculated as 0.11 and is non-significant. This is because only 60 children were surveyed in each period. Here, the reduction in the admission rate by 15% represents a clinically important difference, but not statistically significant. This situation is represented in scenario (d) of Figure 4.1.\nThe important thing to remember is that statistical significance does not always correspond to practical importance. A statistically significant result may be practically unimportant, and a statistically non-significant results may be practically important."

If the P-value is not small, there is little evidence against the null hypothesis and we fail to reject the null hypothesis. As discussed above, the “small” cut-point for the P-value is often taken as 0.05. We refer to this value as \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha).\nWe can conduct a thought experiment and compare our hypothesis test conclusion to reality. In reality, either the null hypothesis is true, or it is false. Of course, if we knew what reality was, we would not need to conduct a hypothesis test. But we can compare our possible hypothesis test conclusions to the true (unobserved) reality.\nIf the null hypothesis was true in reality, our hypothesis test can fail to reject the null hypothesis – this would be a correct conclusion. However, the hypothesis test could lead us to rejecting the null hypothesis – this would be an incorrect conclusion. We call this scenario a Type I error, and it has a probability of \\(\\alpha\\).\nThe other situation is where, in reality, the null hypothesis is false. A correct conclusion would be where our hypothesis test rejects the null hypothesis. However, if our hypothesis test fails to reject the null hypothesis, we have made a Type II error. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted \\(\\beta\\) (beta). We will see in Module 10 that \\(\\beta\\) is determined by the size of the study.\nThe error in falsely rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (type I error), or in falsely accepting the null hypothesis when it is not true (type II error) is summarised in Table 4.2.

The 95% confidence intervals around other summary statistics can also be calculated.\nFor example, if we were comparing the means of two groups, we would want to test the null hypothesis that the difference in means is zero, that there is no true difference between the groups.\nFrom the data from the two groups, we could estimate the difference in means, the standard error of the difference in means and the 95% confidence interval around the difference. To estimate the 95% confidence interval, we use the formula given in Module 3, that is:\n\\[ 95\\% \\text{ CI} = \\text{Difference in means} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(\\text{Difference in means)} \\]\nIt is important to remember that the 95% CI is estimated from the standard error, and that the standard error has a direct relationship to the sample size. For small sample sizes, the standard error is large and the 95% CI becomes wider. Conversely, the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error and the narrower the 95% CI becomes indicating a more precise estimate of the mean difference.\nThe 95% CI tells us the region in which we are 95% confident that the true difference between the groups in the population lies. If this region contains the null value of no difference, we can say that we are 95% confident that there is no true difference between the groups and therefore we would not reject the null hypothesis. This is shown in the top two estimates in Figure 4.2. If the zero value lies outside the 95% confidence interval, we can conclude that there is evidence of a difference between the groups because we are 95% confident that the difference does not encompass a zero value (as shown in the lower two estimates in Figure 4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Using confidence intervals as informal hypothesis tests\n\n\n\n\nFor relative risk and odds ratio measures, when the 95% CI includes the value of 1 it indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true RR or OR of the association between the study factor and outcome factor includes 1.0 in the source population. This indicates little evidence of an association between the study factor and the outcome factor, e.g. if the results of a study were reported as RR = 1.10 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.25).

The t-distribution and its relation to normal distribution has been discussed in detailed in Module 3.\nIn a one-sample t-test, a t-value is computed as the sample mean divided by the standard error of the mean. The significance of the t-value is then computed using software, or can be obtained from a statistical table.\nThe principles of this test can be used for applications such as testing whether the mean of a sample is different from a known population mean, for example testing whether the IQ of a group of children is different from the population mean of 100 IQ points or testing whether the number of average hours worked in an adult sample is different from the population mean of 38 hours.\n\n4.7.1 Worked Example\nThe mean diastolic blood pressure (BP) of the general US population is known to be 71 mm Hg. The diastolic blood pressure of 733 female Pima indigenous Americans was measured and a histogram showed that the data were approximately normally distributed. The mean diastolic blood pressure in the sample was 72.4 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 12.38 mm Hg.\nWe can use Stata or R to conduct a one sample t-test using the data available on Moodle (mod04_blood_pressure.csv).

Note that this interval does not contain the mean of the general US population (71 mm Hg), providing some indication that the mean diastolic blood pressure of female Pima people is higher than that of the general US population.\nThe result from the formal hypothesis test gives strong evidence that the mean diastolic BP of the female Pima people is higher than that of the general US population (t732=3.07, P=0.002)."

    "text": "4.8 One and two tailed tests\nMost statistical tests are two tailed tests, that is, we conduct a test that allows for the summary statistic in the group of interest to be either higher or lower than in the comparison group. For a t-test, this requires that we obtain a two-tailed P value which gives us the probability of the t-value being in either one of the two tails of the t-distribution as shown in Figure 4.3. The shaded regions show the t values that indicate a P value less than 0.05.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: P-value for a 2-tailed test\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally, one tailed tests are conducted in which the summary statistic in the group of interest can only be higher or lower than the comparison group, i.e. a difference is specified to occur in one direction only. This makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis because the consequence is that the P value is essentially halved. The P value for a one tailed test would be 0.025 i.e. the shaded region for a one-tailed test would be retained on one side of the distribution and eliminated from the other side of the distribution as shown in Figure 4.4.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: P-value for 1-tailed tests\n\n\n\n\nIf a one tailed P value is reported, and is considered to be an invalid decision, it is usually easily converted to a two tailed value by doubling its numeric value. For example, for the same test statistic and sample size:\n\nOne tailed P value = 0.042 i.e. statistically significant\nTwo tailed P value = 0.084 i.e. non-significant\n\nObviously, the choice of whether to use a one or two tailed test is not as important when the P value is highly significant or clearly non-significant but can make a difference to the conclusions when the P value is on the margins of significance.\nIn most health research, the use of a one tailed test is rarely justified because it is unusual to be certain of the direction of effect prior to the research study being undertaken. It has been suggested that if the researchers were sure enough to consider using a one-tailed test, the research study would not be needed.\nIn most studies, two tailed tests of significance are used to allow for the possibility that the effect size could occur in either direction. In clinical trials, this would mean allowing for a result that can indicate a benefit or an adverse effect in response to a new treatment. In epidemiological studies, two tailed tests are used to allow for the fact that exposure to a factor of interest may be adverse or may be beneficial. This conservative approach is usually adopted to prevent missing important effects that occur in the opposite direction to that expected by the researchers."

    "section": "5.1 Introduction",
    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nIn Module 4, a one-sample t-test was used for comparing a single mean to a hypothesised value. In health research, we often want to compare the means between two groups. For example, in an observational study, we may want to compare cholesterol levels in people who exercise regularly to the levels in people who do not exercise regularly. In a clinical trial, we may want to compare cholesterol levels in people who have been randomised to a dietary modification or to usual care. In this module, we show how to compare the means of two groups where the analysis variable is normally distributed.\nFrom the decision tree presented in the Appendix, we can see that if we have a continuous outcome measure and two categorical groups that are not related, i.e. a binary exposure measurement, the test for such data is an independent samples t-test. The test is also sometimes called a 2-sample t-test.\nIn research, data are often ‘paired’ or ‘matched’, that is the two data points are related to one another. This occurs when measurements are taken:\n\nFrom each participant on two occasions, e.g. at baseline and follow-up in an experimental study or in a longitudinal cohort study;\nFrom related people, e.g. a mother and daughter or a child and their sibling;\nFrom related sites in the same person, e.g. from both limbs, eyes or kidneys;\nFrom matched participants e.g. in a matched case-control study;\nIn cross-over clinical trials where the patient receives both drugs, often in random order.\n\nAn independent samples t-test cannot be used for analysing paired or matched data because the assumption that the two groups are independent is violated. Treating paired or matched measurements as independent samples would artificially inflate the sample size and lead to inaccurate P values. When the data are related in a paired or matched way and the outcome is continuous, a paired t-test is the appropriate statistic to use if the data are normally distributed."

    "text": "5.2 Independent samples t-test\nAn independent samples t-test is a parametric test that is used to assess whether the mean values of two groups are different from one another. Thus, the test is used to assess whether two mean values are similar enough to have come from the same population or whether the difference between them is so large that the two groups can be considered to have come from separate populations with different characteristics.\nThe null hypothesis is that the mean values of the two groups are not different, that is:\nH0: (\\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\)) = 0\nRejecting the null hypothesis using an independent samples t-test indicates that the difference between the means of the two groups is large in relation to the variability in the samples and is unlikely to be due to chance or to sampling variation.\n\n5.2.1 Assumptions for an independent samples t-test\nThe assumptions that must be met before an independent samples t-test can be used are:\n\nThe two groups are independent\nThe measurements are independent\nThe analysis variable must be continuous and must be normally distributed in each group\n\nThe first two assumptions are determined by the study design. The two samples must be independent, i.e. if a person is in one group then they cannot be included in the other group, and the measurements within a sample must be independent, i.e. each person must be included in their group once only.\nThe third assumption of normality is important although t-tests are robust to some degree of non-normality as long as there are no influential outliers and, more importantly, if the sample size is large. We examined how to assess normality in Module 2. If the data are not normally distributed, it may be possible to transform them using a mathematical function such as a logarithmic transformation. If not, then we may need to use non-parametric tests. This is examined in Module 9.\nTraditionally, the variance of the analysis variable in each group was assumed to be equal. However, this assumption can be relaxed by using Welch’s variation of the t-test. It has been recommended that this unequal-variances t-test be used in most, if not all situations (West 2021; Delacre, Lakens, and Leys 2017; Ruxton 2006).\n\n\n5.2.2 Worked Example 5.1\nIn an observational study of a random sample of 100 full term babies from the community, birth weight and gender were measured. There were 44 male babies and 56 female babies in the sample. The research question asked whether there was a difference in birth weights between boys and girls. The two groups are independent of each other and therefore an independent samples t-test can be used to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in weight between the genders.\nSome preliminary descriptive statistics of the distribution of the variable of interest in each group should always be obtained before a t-test is undertaken to ensure that the assumptions are met. Box plots and histograms are ideal for this. Histrograms and box plots of the data obtained in Stata using Graphics &gt; Box plot is shown in Figure 5.1. The datasets mod05_birthweight.dta and mod05_birthweight.rds are available on Moodle.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Histograms and box plots of birth weight by gender\n\n\n\n\nThe plots show that the data are approximately normally distributed: the histograms are relatively bell shaped and symmetric, and the boxes are fairly symmetrical, there are no outliers, and the spread is similar in both groups as the similar length of the whiskers suggesting that the variance is equal between groups.\nWe can also describe the data using summary statistics:\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1:  Summary of birthweight by gender \n\nCharacteristic\nFemale\nMale\n\n\nBirthweight\n\nN5644\n\nMean (SD)3.59 (0.36)3.42 (0.35)\n\nMedian (IQR)3.53 (3.33, 3.87)3.43 (3.16, 3.63)\n\nRange2.95, 4.252.75, 4.10\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table shows that girls have a mean weight of 3.59 kg (SD 0.36) and boys have a mean weight of 3.42 kg (SD 0.35) with females being heavier than males. The variabilities of birth weight, as indicated by the standard deviations, are similar.\n\n\n5.2.3 Conducting and interpreting an independent samples t-test\nAn independent samples t-test provides us with a t statistic from which we can compute a P value. The computation of the t statistic is as follows:\n\\[t = \\frac{{\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2}}{SE({\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2})}\\]\nwith the standard error and degrees of freedom calculated from software. Note that by using Welch’s t-test, the degrees of freedom will usually not be a whole number, and will appear with decimals.\nLooking at the formula for the t-statistic, we can see that the \\(t\\) is an estimate of how different the mean values are compared to the variability of the difference in means. So \\(t\\) will become larger as the difference in means increases with respect to the variability.\nStatistical software will calculate both the t and P values. If the t-value is large, the P value will be small, providing evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups.\nTable 5.2 summarises the results of an independent samples t-test using mod05_birthweight.dta or mod05_birthweight.rds. The process of conducting the t-test is summarised for Stata and R in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2:  Birthweight (kg) by sex \n\nSexnMean (SE)95% Confidence Interval\n\nFemale563.59 (0.049)3.49 to 3.68\n\nMale443.42 (0.053)3.31 to 3.53\n\nDifference0.17 (0.072)0.02 to 0.31\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see that girls are heavier than boys, and the mean difference in weights between the genders is 0.17 kg (95% CI 0.02, 0.31). We are 95% confident that the true mean difference of weight between girls and boys lies between 0.02 and 0.31 kg. Note that this interval does not contain the null value of 0.\nHere we are testing the null hypothesis of no difference in mean birthweights between females and males: a two-sided test. The t-value is calculated as 2.30 with 93.5 degrees of freedom, and yields a two-sided P value of 0.023, providing evidence of a difference in mean birthweight between sex."

    "text": "5.3 Paired t-tests\nIf the outcome of interest is the difference in the continuously outcome measurement between each pair of observations, a paired t-test is used. In effect, a paired t-test is used to assess whether the mean of the differences between the two related measurements is significantly different from zero. In this sense, a paired t-test is very closely aligned with a one sample t-test.\nWhen using a paired t-test, the variation between the pairs of measurements is the most important statistic. The variation between the participants is of little interest.\nFor related measurements, the data for each pair of values must be entered on the same row of the spreadsheet. Thus, the number of rows in the data sheet is the number of pairs of observations. Thus, the effective sample size is the total number of pairs and not the total number of measurements.\n\n5.3.1 Assumptions for a paired t-test\nThe assumptions for a paired t-test are:\n\nthe outcome variable is continuous\nthe differences between the pair of the measurements are normally distributed\n\nFor a paired samples t-test, it is important to test whether the differences between the two measurements are normally distributed. If the assumptions for a paired t-test cannot be met, a non-parametric equivalent is a more appropriate test to use (Module 9).\n\n\n5.3.2 Computing a paired t-test\nThe null hypothesis for using a paired t-test is as follows:\nH0: Mean (Measurement1 – Measurement2) = 0\nTo compute a t-value, the size of the mean difference between the two measurements is compared to the standard error of the paired differences, i.e.\n\\[t = \\frac{\\overline{d}}{SE(\\overline{d})}\\]\nwith n–1 degrees of freedom, where n is the number of pairs.\nBecause the standard error becomes smaller as the sample size becomes larger, the t-value increases as the sample size increases for the same mean difference.\n\n\n5.3.3 Worked Example 5.2\nA total of 107 people were recruited into a study to assess whether ankle blood pressure measured in two different sites would be the same. For each person, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured in two sites: dorsalis pedis and tibialis posterior.\nThe dataset mod05_ankle_bp.xls is available on Moodle. First, we need to compute the pairwise difference between SBP measured in the two sites. The distribution of the difference between SBP measured in dorsalis pedis and tibialis posterior is shown in Figure 5.2. The differences approximate a normal distribution and therefore a paired t-test can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Distribution of differences in ankle SBP between two sites of 107 participants\n\n\n\n\nThe paired t-test can be performed using statistical software, with a summary of the results presented in Table 5.3. We can see that the mean SBP is very similar in the two sites.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3:  Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) measured at two sites on the ankle \n\nSitenMean (SE)95% Confidence Interval\n\nDorsalis pedis107116.7 (3.46)(109.9 to 123.6)\n\nTibialis posterior107118.0 (3.43)(111.2 to 124.8)\n\nDifference107-1.3 (1.31)(-3.9 to 1.3)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe t-value is calculated as −0.96 with 106 degrees of freedom, providing a two-sided P-value of 0.34. Thus these data provide no evidence of a difference in systolic blood pressure between the two sites."

    "section": "6.2 Calculating proportions and 95% confidence intervals",
    "text": "6.2 Calculating proportions and 95% confidence intervals\n\n6.2.1 Calculating a proportion\nWe need two pieces of information to calculate a proportion: \\(n\\), the number of trials, and \\(k\\), the number of ‘successes’. Note that we use the term ‘success’ to describe the outcome of interest, recognising that a success may be a adverse outcome such as death or disease.\nThe following formula is used to calculate the proportion, \\(p\\):\n\\[ p = k / n \\]\nThe proportion, \\(p\\), is a number that lies between 0 and 1. Proportions and their confidence intervals can easily be converted to percentages by multiplying by 100 once computed.\nAs for all summary statistics, it is useful to compute the precision of the estimate as a 95% confidence interval (CI) to indicate the range of values in which are 95% confident that the true population value lies. In this module, we present two methods for computing a 95% confidence interval around a proportion.\n\n\n6.2.2 Calculating the 95% confidence interval of a proportion (Wald method)\nThe Wald method for calculating the 95% confidence interval is based on assuming that the proportion, \\(p\\), is Normally distributed. This assumption is reasonable if the sample is sufficiently large (for example, if \\(n&gt;30\\)) and if \\(n \\times (1-p)\\) and \\(n \\times p\\) are both larger than 5.\nThe Wald method for calculating a 95% confidence interval is given by:\n\\[\\text{95\\% CI} = p \\pm (1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(p))\\]\nwhere the standard error of a proportion is computed as:\n\\[\\text{SE}(p) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p \\times (1 - p)}{n}}\\]\n\n\n6.2.3 Worked Example 6.1\nIn a cross-sectional study of children living in a rural village, 47 children from a random sample of 215 children were found to have scabies. Here \\(n=215\\) and \\(k=47\\), so the proportion of children with scabies is estimated as:\n\\[ p = \\frac{47}{215} = 0.2186 \\]\nGiven the large sample size and the number of children with the rarer outcome is larger than 5, the Wald method is used to calculate the standard error of the proportion as:\n\\[{\\text{SE}\\left( p \\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2186 \\times (1 - 0.2186)}{215}}\n}{= 0.02819}\\]\nThen, the 95% confidence interval is estimated as:\n\\[\\text{95\\% CI} = 0.2816 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.02819\\]\n\\[= 0.1634 \\text{ to } 0.2739\\]\nThe prevalence of scabies among children in the village is 21.9% (95% CI 16.3%, 27.4%). These values tell us that we are 95% confident that the true prevalence of scabies among children in the village is between 16.3% and 27.4%.\n\n\n6.2.4 Calculating the 95% confidence interval of a proportion (Wilson method)\nAnother method to calculate the confidence interval of a proportion is the Wilson (sometimes also called the ‘score’) method. We can use it in situations where it is not appropriate to use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution as described above i.e. if the sample size is small (\\(n &lt; 30\\)) or the number of subjects with the rarer outcome is 5 or fewer. This method much more difficult to implement by hand than the standard confidence interval, and so we will not discuss the hand calculation using the mathematical equation in this course. Instead, we use statistical software to do this (see the Stata or R notes for detail).\nWhen using software, our worked example provides a 95% confidence interval of the prevalence of scabies of 16.9% to 27.9%.\n\n\n6.2.5 Wald vs Wilson methods\nThe Wald method, which assumes that the underlying proportion follows a Normal distribution, is easy to calculate and follows the form of other confidence intervals. The Wilson method, which is difficult to calculate by hand, has nicer mathematical properties. There are also a number of other methods for calculating confidence intervals for proportions, but we do not discuss these in this course.\nA paper by Brown, Cai and DasGupta (Brown, Cai, and DasGupta (2001)) has compared the properties of the Wald and Wilson methods (among others) and concluded that the Wilson method is preferred over the Wald method. Therefore, we recommend the Wilson method be used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for a proportion."

    "section": "6.3 Hypothesis testing for one sample proportion",
    "text": "6.3 Hypothesis testing for one sample proportion\nWe can carry out a hypothesis test to compare a sample proportion to a hypothesised proportion. In much the same way as a one sample t-test was used in Module 5 to test a sample mean against a hypothesised mean, we can perform a one-sample test to test a sample proportion against a hypothesised proportion. The significance test will provide a P-value to assess the evidence against the null hypothesis, while the 95% confidence interval will provide the range in which we are 95% confident that the true proportion lies.\nFor example, we can test the following null hypothesis:\nH0: sample proportion is not different from the hypothesised proportion\nMuch like constructing a 95% confidence interval, there are two main options when performing a hypothesis test on a single proportion: the first assumes that the proportion follows a Normal distribution, while the second relaxes this assumption.\n\n6.3.1 z-test for testing one sample proportion\nThe first step in the z-test is to calculate a z-statistic, which is then used to calculate a P-value. The z-statistic is calculated as the difference between the population proportion and the sample proportion divided by the standard error of the population proportion, i.e.\n\\[\nz = \\frac{(p_{sample} - p_{population})}{\\text{SE}(p_{population})}\n\\]\nThis z-statistic is then compared to the standard Normal distribution to calculate the P-value.\n\n\n6.3.2 Worked Example 6.2\nA national census in a country shows that 20% of the population are smokers. A survey of a community within the country that has received a public health anti-smoking intervention shows that 54 of 300 people sampled are smokers (18%). We can calculate a 95% confidence interval around this proportion using the Wilson method, which is calculated as 14.1% to 22.7%.\nThe researchers are interested in whether the proportion of smoking in this community is the same as the population prevalence of smoking of 20%. The null hypothesis can be written as: H0: the proportion of smokers in the community is 20% (the same as in the national census).\nWe can test this by calculating a z-statistic:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nz &= \\frac{(0.18 - 0.20)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.20 × (1 - 0.20)}{300}}} \\\\\n&= -0.87\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe P-value for the test above can be obtained from a Normal distribution table as \\(P = 2 × 0.192 = 0.38\\) (using Table A2.1 in the Appendix), or using the hand-calculator in Stata. This indicates that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is a difference between the proportion of smokers in the community and the country. This is consistent with our 95% confidence interval which crosses the null value of 20%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Binomial test for testing one sample proportion\nWe can use the binomial distribution to obtain an exact P-value for testing a single proportion. Historically, this was a time consuming process with much hand calculation. These days, statistical software performs the calculations quickly and efficiently, and is the preferred method.\n\n\n6.3.4 Worked example 6.3\nThe file mod06_smoking_status.csv contains the data for this example. In the data file, smokers are coded as 1 and non-smokers are coded as 0.\nIn Stata, we can use the prtest command to perform a z-test, or the bitest command to perform the exact binomial test. In R, we can use the prop.test function to perform a z-test, or the binom.test function to perform the exact binomial test.\nThe z-test provides a two-sided P-value of 0.39, while the binomial test gives a two-sided P-value of 0.43. Both tests provide little evidence against the hypothesis that the prevalence of smoking in the community is 20%."

In the simplest form of a randomised controlled trial, a group of participants is randomly allocated to a group that receives the treatment of interest or to a control group that does not receive the treatment of interest. Participants are followed up over time, and the outcome is measured at the conclusion of the study.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design of a randomised controlled trial [Figure 4.1, Essential Epidemiology]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.2 Cohort study\nA cohort study is an observational study that addresses the research question: what is the effect of an exposure on an outcome. This research question is similar to that studied in a randomised controlled trial, but the exposure is defined by the participants’ circumstances, and not manipulated by the researchers. In a cohort study, participants without the outcome of interest are enrolled, followed over time, and information on their exposure to a factor is measured (either at baseline or over time). At the conclusion of the study, information on the outcome is measured to identify new (incident) cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design of a cohort study [Figure 4.2, Essential Epidemiology]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.3 Case control study\nWhile the randomised controlled trial and cohort study begin with a population without the outcome, a case-control study begins by assembling a group with the outcome of interest (cases), and a group without the outcome of interest (controls).

The relative risk is a direct comparison of the risk in the exposed group with the risk in the non-exposed group, and can only be calculated for a cohort study (including a randomised controlled trial) or a cross-sectional study (where it is also called a prevalence ratio).\nFor cohort studies, randomised controlled trials and cross-section studies, we can calculate an absolute measure of association between an exposure and an outcome as a difference in proportions (also known as an attributable risk).\nFor case-control studies, as we sample participants based on their outcome, we can not estimate the risk of the outcome. Hence, calculating a relative risk or risk difference is inappropriate. Instead of calculating risks in a case-control study, we instead calculate odds, where the odds of an event are calculated as the number with the event divided by the number without the event.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.3:  Contingency table for a case-control study \n\n CasesControlsTotal\n\nExposure presentaba+b\n\nExposure absentcdc+d\n\nTotala+cb+dN\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example in Table Table 6.3, we can calculate the odds of being exposed in the cases as \\(a \\div c\\).

We can the calculate the odds ratio as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Odds ratio} &= (a \\div c) \\div (b \\div d) \\\\\n&= \\frac{a \\times d}{b \\times c} \\\\\n&= \\frac{ad}{bc}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that some authors say we should think of the odds ratio being based on the odds of being a case in the exposed group compared to the odds of being a case in the unexposed group. Here, the exposed group comprises cells “a” and “b”, so the odds of being a case in the exposed group is (a/b). Similarly, for the unexposed group, the odds of being exposed is (c/d). So our odds ratio becomes (a/b) / (c/d). If we rearrange this, we get the same odds ratio as above: (ad)/(bc).\nThe interpretation of an odds ratio is discussed in detail in PHCM9794: Foundations of Epidemiology, and an excerpt is presented here: The meaning of the calculated odds ratio as a measure of association between exposure and outcome is the same as for the rate ratio (relative risk) where:\n\nAn odds ratio &gt;1 indicates that exposure is positively associated with disease (i.e. the exposure may be a cause of disease);\nAn odds ratio &lt; 1 indicates that exposure is negatively associated with disease (i.e. the exposure may be protective against disease); and\nAn odds ratio = 1 indicates no association between the exposure and the outcome.\n\nIn some situations, related to how well controls are recruited into this study, the odds ratio is a close approximation of the relative risk. Therefore, you may see in some published papers of case control studies the OR interpreted as you would interpret a RR. This should be avoided in this course.\nMore information about the problems of interpreting odds-ratios as relative risks has been presented by Deeks (1998) and Schmidt and Kohlmann (2008).\n\n6.6.1 Worked Example 6.4\nA randomised controlled trial was conducted among a group of patients to estimate the side effects of a drug. Fifty patients were randomly allocated to receive the active drug and 50 patients were allocated to receive a placebo drug. The outcome measured was the experience of nausea. The data is given in the files mod06_nausea.dta and mod06_nausea.rds.\nA summary table can be constructed as in Table 6.4.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.4:  Nausea status by drug exposure \n\n NauseaNo nauseaTotal\n\nActive drug153550\n\nPlacebo44650\n\nTotal1981100\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use Stata or R to calculate the relative risk (RR=3.75) and its 95% confidence interval (1.34 to 10.51). This tells us that nausea is 3.75 times more likely to occur in the active drug group compared with the placebo group. Because this is a randomised controlled trial, the relative risk would be an appropriate measure of association.\nWe can confirm the estimated relative risk:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{RR} &= \\frac{a / (a+b)}{c / (c+d)} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{15 / (15+35)}{4 / (4+46)} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{0.3}{0.08} \\\\\n  &= 3.75\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n6.6.2 Worked Example 6.5\nA case-control study investigated the association between human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer (D'Souza, et al. NEJM 2007), and the results appear in Table 6.5.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.5:  Association between human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer \n\n CasesControlsTotal\n\n(Oropharyngeal cancer)(No oropharyngeal cancer)\n\nHPV Positive571471\n\nHPV Negative43186229\n\nTotal100200300\n\n\n\n\n\nThe odds ratio is the odds of being HPV positive in cases (those with oropharyngeal cancer) compared to the odds of being HPV positive in the controls (those without oropharyngeal cancer):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{OR} &= \\frac{a / c}{b /d} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{57 / 43}{14 / 186} \\\\\n  &= 17.6\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can use Stata or R to estimate the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. We should use the Cornfield option in Stata to provide a better estimate of the 95% confidence interval. It appears that the jmv package in R does not use the Cornfield approximation to estimate the 95% confidence interval, but uses the Woolf method.\nThe odds ratio is estimated as 17.6, and its 95% confidence interval is estimated 9.0 to 34.3 (Cornfield, using Stata) or 9.0 to 34.5 (Woolf, using R).\nThe interpretation of the confidence intervals for both the relative risk and the odds ratio is the same as for the confidence intervals around other summary measures in that it shows the region in which we are 95% confident that the true population estimate lies."

To calculate these estimates correctly, we must define the positive exposure and positive outcome to be the first level of a factor. When defining an exposure for example, we should define the active treatment or the positive exposure as the first category. When defining an outcome, we should define the category of interest (e.g. disease, or side effect) as the first category.\nIn this example, we will define Active as the first level in the group factor, and Nausea to be the first level of the side_effect factor.\nWe can do this using the relevel() function, which re-orders the levels of a factor so that the level specified is defined as the first level, and the others are moved down:\n\n# Define \"Active\" as the first level of group:\ndrug$group &lt;- relevel(drug$group, ref=\"Active\")\n\n\n# Define \"Nausea\" as the first level of side_effect:\ndrug$side_effect &lt;- relevel(drug$side_effect, ref=\"Nausea\")\n\nUpon re-leveling the factors, we can check that the levels of interest have been defined as the first levels:\n\nsummary(drug)\n\n     group       side_effect\n Active :50   Nausea   :19  \n Placebo:50   No nausea:81  \n\n\nTo construct the 2-by-2 table and calculate a relative risk, we use the contTables() function in jmv. We request the row-percents using pcRow = TRUE and the relative risk and confidence interval using relRisk = TRUE:\n\ncontTables(data=drug, \n           rows=group, cols=side_effect, \n           pcRow=TRUE, relRisk = TRUE)\n\n\n CONTINGENCY TABLES\n\n Contingency Tables                                                 \n ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   group                      Nausea       No nausea    Total       \n ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   Active     Observed               15           35           50   \n              % within row     30.00000     70.00000    100.00000   \n                                                                    \n   Placebo    Observed                4           46           50   \n              % within row      8.00000     92.00000    100.00000   \n                                                                    \n   Total      Observed               19           81          100   \n              % within row     19.00000     81.00000    100.00000   \n ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n\n\n χ² Tests                              \n ───────────────────────────────────── \n         Value       df    p           \n ───────────────────────────────────── \n   χ²    7.862248     1    0.0050478   \n   N          100                      \n ───────────────────────────────────── \n\n\n Comparative Measures                                    \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n                    Value         Lower       Upper      \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   Relative risk    3.750000 ᵃ    1.337540    10.51370   \n ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n   ᵃ Rows compared\n\n\nIf you only have the cross-tabulated data (i.e. aggregated), you will need to enter your data into a new data frame.

Here we must define the levels in the order we want the categories to appear in the table. Note that as group and side_effect are entered as text variables, we can omit labels command when defining the factors, and the factor will be labelled using the text entry:\n\ndrug_aggregated$group &lt;- factor(drug_aggregated$group, \n                                levels=c(\"Active\", \"Placebo\"))\n\ndrug_aggregated$side_effect &lt;- factor(drug_aggregated$side_effect, \n                                      levels=c(\"Nausea\", \"No nausea\"))\n\nWe can calculate the relative risk using the summarised data in the same was done previously.

    "text": "7.1 Introduction\nIn Module 6, we estimated the 95% confidence intervals of proportions and measures of association for categorical data and conducted a significance test comparing a sample proportion to a known value.\nWhen both the outcome variable and the exposure variable are categorical, a chi-squared test can be used as a formal statistical test to assess whether the exposure and outcome are related. The P-value obtained from a chi-squared test gives the probability of obtaining the observed association (or more extreme) if there is in fact no association between the exposure and outcome.\nIn this Module, we also include tests for a difference in proportion for paired data.\n\n7.1.1 Worked Example\nWe are using the randomised controlled trial as given in Worked Example 6.4 on the nauseating side effect of a drug.\nThe research question is whether the active drug resulted in a different rate of nausea than the placebo drug. This is equivalent to testing whether there is an association between nausea and type of drug received (active or placebo). Thus, we will test the null hypothesis that the experience of nausea and the treatment are not related to one another. The null hypothesis is:\n\nH0: The proportion with nausea in the active drug group is the same as the proportion with nausea in the placebo drug group.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis can be stated as:\n\nHa: The proportion with nausea in the active drug group is different to the proportion with nausea in the placebo drug group."

    "section": "7.2 Chi-squared test for independent proportions",
    "text": "7.2 Chi-squared test for independent proportions\nA chi-squared test is used to test the null hypothesis that of no association between two categorical variables. First a contingency table is drawn up and then we estimate the counts of each cell (i.e. a, b, c and d) that would be expected if the null hypothesis was true. The row and column totals are used to calculate expected counts in each cell of the contingency table as follows:\nExpected count = (Row count × Column count) / Total count\nStatistical software will do this for us, as described in the Stata or R sections in this Module.\nA chi-squared value is then calculated to compare the expected counts (E) in each cell with the observed (actual) cell counts (O). The calculation is as follows:\n\\(\\chi ^ 2 = \\sum \\frac{(O - E)}{E} ^2\\)\nwith [Number of rows \\(-\\) 1] \\(\\times\\) [Number of columns \\(-\\) 1] degrees of freedom.\nAs for many statistics, the deviations between the observed and expected values are squared to prevent the negative and positive values balancing one another out.\nIf the expected counts are close to the observed counts, the chi-squared statistic will be close to zero, and the P-value will be close to 1. The larger the difference between the observed and expected counts, the larger the chi-squared statistic becomes (and the smaller the P-value). A large chi-squared statistic provides more evidence of an association between the exposure and outcome.\n\n7.2.1 Assumptions for using a Pearson’s chi-squared test\nThe assumptions that must be met when using Pearson’s chi-squared test are that:\n\neach observation must be independent;\neach participant is represented in the table once only;\nat least 80% of the expected cell counts should exceed a value of five;\nall expected cell counts should exceed a value of one.\n\nThe first two assumptions are dictated by the study design. The last two assumptions relate to the numbers in the cells and should be explored when running the test. There should not be too many cells with low expected counts.\n\n\n7.2.2 Worked Example 7.1\nWe will revisit Worked Example 6.4, investigating the relationship between nausea and drug exposure:\n\n\nTable 7.1: Nausea status by drug exposure\n\n\n\nNausea\nNo nausea\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nActive\n15 (30%)\n35 (70%)\n50 (100%)\n\n\nPlacebo\n4 (8%)\n46 (92%)\n50 (100%)\n\n\nTotal\n19 (19%)\n81 (81%)\n100 (100%)\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the row percentages that 8% of patients in the placebo group experienced nausea compared to 30% of patients in the active group. If no association existed, we would expect to find approximately the same percent of patients with nausea in each group. Statistical software can calculate the values we would expect if there was no association between nausea and drug exposure (i.e. the expected counts):\n\n\nTable 7.2: Expected counts of nausea status by drug exposure\n\n\n\nNausea\nNo nausea\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nActive\n9.5\n40.5\n50\n\n\nPlacebo\n9.5\n40.5\n50\n\n\nTotal\n19\n81\n100\n\n\n\n\nFor the data being considered from Worked Example 7.1 all cells have an expected count greater than 5 and that the minimum cell count is 9.5. Therefore, it is appropriate to use the Pearson’s Chi-Squared test. Note that the ‘Expected’ counts are higher for the groups with ‘No nausea’ because ‘No nausea’ is more prevalent in the sample than ‘Nausea’.\nThe chi-squared statistic is calculated as 7.86 with 1 df, giving a P-value of 0.005. Combining these results with the estimated relative risk (from Module 6), we can state:\nThe proportion with nausea in those who received the active drug is 30%, compared to 8% in those who received the placebo drug. Nausea was more frequent in those who received the active drug (Relative Risk = 3.75, 95% CI: 1.34 to 10.51). There is strong evidence that the proportion with nausea differs between the two groups (\\(\\chi ^2\\) = 7.86 with 1 df, P=0.005).\n\n\n7.2.3 Fisher’s exact test\nIf small expected cell counts are present, Fisher’s exact test can be used instead. More information on Fisher’s exact test can be found in Chapter 13 of An Introduction to Medical Statistics, Bland (2015), or Section 17.3 of Essential Medical Statistics, Kirkwood and Sterne (2001). The computation of Fisher’s exact test is complex, and best conducted by statistical software.\nA reasonable question could be posed: why not conduct Fisher’s exact test by default? The answer to this is complex.\nFisher’s exact test has quite a restrictive assumption: we assume that the totals of the rows and columns are fixed before we conduct the study.\nFrom Worked Example 7.1, this would be saying that we knew we would end up with 50 people in the active treatment arm, and 50 people in the placebo. This seems reasonable, we can design our study to randomise equal groups. However, Fisher’s exact test also assumes that we know we will obtain 19 people with nausea and 81 people without nausea. We cannot possibly know this before we do the study.\nIn the case where we cannot assume that the totals of the rows and columns are fixed before we conduct the study, it can be shown that Fisher’s exact test will be conservative (we will be less likely to reject the null hypothesis when it is false, or in other words, the P-value will be larger than it should be).\nWhile there are other tests that perform better than Fisher’s exact test, most of the time we live with this conservative test when we have to (i.e. for small expected cell counts) because Fisher’s exact test is so widely known.\nPragmatically, we use the standard (Pearson) chi-square when we can, and Fisher’s exact test only when we have small expected cell counts."

When a contingency table larger than 2-by-2 is used, say a 4-by-2 table if there were 4 exposure groups, the Pearson’s chi-squared can still be used.\n\n7.3.1 Worked Example 7.2\nThe files mod07_allergy.dta and mod07_allergy.rds contain information about the severity of allergic reaction, coded as absent, slight, moderate or severe. We can test the hypothesis that the severity of allergy is not different between males and females. To do this we can use a two-way tabulation to obtain Table 7.3 which shows the counts, expected counts and the percent of females and males who fall into each severity group for allergy. The table shows that the percentage of males is higher in each of the categories of severity (slight, moderate, severe) than the percentage of females.\n\n\nTable 7.3: Allergy data\n\n\n\n\n(a) Observed counts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex\nNon-allergenic\nSlight allergy\nModerate allergy\nSevere allergy\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nFemale\n150 (62.0%)\n50 (20.7%)\n27 (11.2%)\n15 (6.2%)\n242 (100%)\n\n\nMale\n137 (53.1%)\n70 (27.1%)\n32 (12.4%)\n19 (7.4%)\n258 (100%)\n\n\nTotal\n287 (57.4%)\n120 (24.0%)\n59 (11.8%)\n34 (6.8%)\n500 (100.0%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Expected counts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex\nNon-allergenic\nSlight allergy\nModerate allergy\nSevere allergy\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nFemale\n138.9\n58.1\n28.6\n16.5\n242.0\n\n\nMale\n148.1\n61.9\n30.4\n17.5\n258.0\n\n\nTotal\n287.0\n120.0\n59.0\n34.0\n500.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pearson chi-squared statistic is calculated as 4.31, with 3 degrees of freedom, providing a P-value of 0.23.

    "text": "7.4 McNemar’s test for categorical paired data\nIf a binary categorical outcome is measured in a paired study design, McNemar’s statistic is used. This statistic is a form of chi-square applied to a paired situation. A Pearson’s chi-squared test cannot be used because the measurements are not independent. However, McNemar’s test can be used to assess whether there is a significant change in proportions between two time points or between two conditions, or whether there is a significant difference in proportions between matched cases and controls.\nFor McNemar’s test, the data are displayed as shown in Table 7.4. Cells ‘a’ and ‘d’ called concordant cells because the response was the same at both baseline and follow-up or between matched cases and controls. Cells ‘b’ and ‘c’ are called discordant cells because the responses between the pairs were different. For a follow-up study, the participants in cell ‘c’ had a positive response at baseline and a negative response at follow-up. Conversely, the participants in cell ‘b’ had a negative response at baseline and a positive response at follow-up.\nFor other types of paired data such as twins or matched cases and controls, the data are similarly displayed with the responses of one of the pairs in the columns and the responses for the other of the pairs in the rows. For paired data, the grand total ‘N’ is always the number of pairs and not the total number of participants.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.4:  Table layout for testing matched proportions \n\n Negative at follow-upPositive at follow-upTotal\n\nNegative at baselineaba + b\n\nPositive at baselinecdc + d\n\nTotala + cb + dN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.1 Worked Example 7.3\nTwo drugs labelled A and B have been administered to patients in random order so that each patient acts as their own control. The datasets mod07_drug_response.dta and mod07_drug_response.rds are available on Moodle. The null hypothesis is as follows:\n\nH0: The proportion of patients who do better on drug A is the same as the proportion of patients who do better on drug B\n\nCounts and overall percentages are presented in . From the “Total” row in the table, we can see that the number of patients who respond to drug A is 41 (68%) and from the “Total” column the number who respond to drug B is less at 35 (58%), that is there is a difference of 10%.\n\nPaired data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse to Drug B\nNo response to Drug B\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nResponse to Drug A\n21 (35%)\n20 (33%)\n41 (68%)\n\n\nNo response to Drug A\n14 (23%)\n5 (8%)\n19 (32%)\n\n\nTotal\n35 (58%)\n25 (42%)\n60 (100%)\n\n\n\nThe difference in the paired proportions is calculated using the simple equation:\n\\[ p_{A} - p_{B} = \\frac{(b - c)}{N} \\]\nHere, \\(p_{A} - p_{B} = \\frac{(20 - 14)}{60} = 0.1\\)\nThe cell counts show that 20 patients responded to Drug A but not to drug B, and 14 patients responded to Drug B but not to drug A. McNemar’s statistic is computed from these two discordant pairs (labelled as ‘b’ and ‘c’) as follows:\n\\[ X^2 = \\frac{(b-c)^2}{b+c} \\]\nwith 1 degree of freedom. Using our worked example, the McNemar’s chi-squared statistic is calculated as 1.06 with 1 degree of freedom, giving a P-value of 0.3.\nNote that some packages also calculate an “Exact P-Value”. The standard McNemar’s chi-squared statistic is generally recommended, unless the sum of the discordant cells is small (Kirkwood and Sterne define small as less than 10; Section 21.3, Kirkwood and Sterne 2001)). Here, \\(b + c = 34\\), so reporting the standard McNemar’s chi-squared statistic is appropriate.\nAs described above, the difference in proportions can be calculated. A 95% confidence interval for this difference can be obtained using statistical software.\nIn this study of 60 participants, where each participant received both drugs, 41 (68%) responded to Drug A and 35 (58%) responded to Drug B. The difference in the proportions responding is estimated as 10% (95% CI -11% to 31%). There is no evidence that the response differed between the two drugs (McNemar’s chi-square=1.06 with 1 degree of freedom, P=0.3)."

    "text": "8.1 Introduction\nIn Module 5, we saw how to test whether the means from two groups are equal - in other words, whether a continuous variable is related to a categorical variable. Sometimes we are interested in how closely two continuous variables are related. For example, we may want to know how closely blood cholesterol levels are related to dietary fat intake in adult men. To measure the strength of association between two continuously distributed variables, a correlation coefficient is used.\nWe may also want to predict a value of a continuous measurement from another continuous measurement. For example, we may want to know predict values of lung capacity from height in a community of adults. A regression model allows us to use one measurement to predict another measurement.\nAlthough both correlation coefficients and regression models can be used to describe the degree of association between two continuous variables, the two methods provide different information. It is important to note that both methods summarise the strength of an association between variables, and do not imply a causal relationship."

We are usually interested in whether one variable is associated with another. If we believe that a change in \\(x\\) will lead to a change in \\(y\\), or that \\(y\\) is influenced by \\(x\\), we define \\(y\\) as the outcome variable and \\(x\\) as the explanatory variable."

    "text": "8.3 Correlation\nWe use correlation to measure the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. Before calculating a correlation coefficient, a scatter plot should first be obtained to give an understanding of the nature of the relationship between the two variables.\n\n8.3.1 Worked Example\nThe file mod08_lung_function.csv has information about height and lung function collected from a random sample of 120 adults. Information was collected on height (cm) and lung function, which was measured as forced vital capacity (FVC), measured in litres. We can obtain a scatter-plot shown in Figure 8.1, where the outcome variable (\\(y\\)) is plotted on the vertical axis, and the explanatory variable (\\(x\\)) is plotted on the horizontal axis.\nFigure 8.1 shows that as height increases, lung function also increases, which is as expected. One or two of the data points are separated from the rest of the data but are not so far away as to be considered outliers because they do not seem to stand out of other observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Association between height and lung function in 120 adults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Correlation coefficients\nA correlation coefficient (r) describes how closely the variables are related, that is the strength of linear association between two continuous variables. The range of the coefficient is from +1 to −1 where +1 is a perfect positive association, 0 is no association and −1 is a perfect inverse association. In general, an absolute (disregarding the sign) r value below 0.3 indicates a weak association, 0.3 to &lt; 0.6 is fair association, 0.6 to &lt; 0.8 is a moderate association, and \\(\\ge\\) 0.8 indicates a strong association.\nThe correlation coefficient is positive when large values of one variable tend to occur with large values of the other, and small values of one variable (y) tend to occur with small values of the other (x) (Figure 8.2 (a and b)). For example, height and weight in healthy children or age and blood pressure.\nThe correlation coefficient is negative when large values of one variable tend to occur with small values of the other, and small values of one variable tend to occur with large values of the other (Figure 8.2 (c and d)). For example, percentage immunised against infectious diseases and under-five mortality rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Scatter plots demonstrating strong and weak, positive and negative associations\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to calculate a P-value associated with a correlation coefficient to test whether the correlation coefficient is different from zero. However, a correlation coefficient with a large P-value does not imply that there is no relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), because the correlation coefficient only tests for a linear association and there may be a non-linear relationship such as a curved or irregular relationship.\nThe assumptions for using a Pearson’s correlation coefficient are that:\n\nobservations are independent;\nboth variables are continuous variables;\nthe relationship between the two variables is linear.\n\nThere is a further assumption that the data follow a bivariate normal distribution. This assumes: y follows a normal distribution for given values of x; and x follows a normal distribution for given values of y. This is quite a technical assumption that we do not discuss further.\nThere are two types of correlation coefficients– the correct one to use is determined by the nature of the variables as shown in Table 8.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.1:  Correlation coefficients and their application \n\nCorrelation coefficientApplication\n\nPearson’s correlation coefficient: rBoth variables are continuous and a bivariate normal distribution can be assumed\n\nSpearman’s rank correlation: rhoBivariate normality cannot be assumed. Also useful when at least one of the variables is ordinal\n\n\n\n\n\nSpearman’s \\(\\rho\\) is calculated using the ranks of the data, rather than the actual values of the data. We will see further examples of such methods in Module 9, when we consider non-parametric tests, which are often based on ranks.\nCorrelation coefficients are often presented in the form of a correlation matrix which can display the correlation between a number of variables in a single table (Table 8.2).\n\n\nTable 8.2: Correlation matrix for Height and FVC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight\nFVC\n\n\nHeight\n1\n0.70\nP &lt; 0.0001\n\n\nFVC\n0.70\nP &lt; 0.0001\n1\n\n\n\n\nThis correlation matrix shows that the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between height and lung function is 0.70 with P&lt;0.0001 indicating very strong evidence of a linear association between height and FVC. A correlation matrix sometimes includes correlations between the same variable, indicated as a correlation coefficient of 1. For example, \\(Height\\) is perfectly correlated with itself (i.e. has a correlation coefficient of 1). Similarly, \\(FVC\\) is perfectly correlated with itself.\nCorrelation coefficients are rarely used as important statistics in their own right because they do not fully explain the relationship between the two variables and the range of the data has an important influence on the size of the coefficient. In addition, the statistical significance of the correlation coefficient is often over interpreted because a small correlation which is of no clinical importance can become statistically significant even with a relatively small sample size. For example, a poor correlation of 0.3 will be statistically significant if the sample size is large enough."

In most cases, the intercept does not have a biologically meaningful interpretation as the explanatory variable cannot take a value of zero. In our working example, the intercept is not meaningful as it is not possible for an adult to have a height of 0cm.\nThe slope of the line is the predicted change in the outcome variable \\(y\\) as the explanatory explanatory variable \\(x\\) increases by 1 unit.\nAn important concept is that regression predicts an expected value of \\(y\\) given an observed value of \\(x\\): any error around the explanatory variable is not taken into account."

The null hypotheses and the alternative hypothesis for testing the slope of a simple linear regression model are:\n\nH0: \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)\nH1: \\(\\beta_1 \\ne 0\\)\n\nTo test the null hypothesis for the regression coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\), the following t-test is used:\n\\[t = b_1 /SE(b_1)\\]\nThis will give a t statistic which can be referred to a t distribution with n − 2 degrees of freedom to calculate the corresponding P-value.\nTable 8.4 shows the estimated regression coefficients for our working example.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.4:  Estimated regression coefficients \n\nTermEstimateStandard errort valueP value95% Confidence interval\n\nIntercept-18.9 2.19 t=-8.60, 118df&lt;0.001-23.22 to -14.53\n\nHeight0.140.013t=10.58, 118df&lt;0.0010.11 to 0.17\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this output, we see that the slope is estimated as 0.14 with an estimated intercept of -18.87.

For example, the predicted FVC for a person 165 cm tall is estimated as:\nFVC = − 18.87347 + (0.1407567 \\(\\times\\) 165.0) = 4.40 L.\nNote that for the purpose of prediction we have kept all the decimal places in the coefficients to avoid rounding error in the intermediate calculation.\n\n8.6.1 Fit of a linear regression model\nAfter fitting a linear regression model, it is important to know how well the model fits the observed data. One way of assessing the model fit is to compute a statistic called coefficient of determination, denoted by \\(R^2\\). It is the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient \\(r: r^2 = R^2\\). Since the range of \\(r\\) is from −1 to 1, \\(R^2\\) must lie between 0 and 1.\n\\(R^2\\) can be interpreted as the proportion of variability in y that can be explained by variability in x. Hence, the following conditions may arise:\nIf \\(R^2 = 1\\), then all variation in y can be explained by variation of x and all data points fall on the regression line.\nIf \\(R^2 = 0\\), then none of the variation in y is related to x at all, and the variable x explains none of the variability in y.\nIf \\(0 &lt; R^2 &lt;1\\), then the variability of y can be partially explained by the variability in x. The larger the \\(R^2\\) value, the better is the fit of the regression model."

    "text": "8.7 Assumptions for linear regression\nRegression is robust to moderate degrees of non-normality in the variables, provided that the sample size is large enough and that there are no influential outliers. Also, the regression equation describes the relationship between the variables and this is not influenced as much by the spread of the data as the correlation coefficient is.\nThe assumptions that must be met when using linear regression are as follows:\n\nobservations are independent;\nthe relationship between the explanatory and the outcome variable is linear;\nthe residuals are normally distributed.\n\nA residual is defined as the difference between the observed and predicted outcome from the regression model. If the predicted value of the outcome variable is denoted by \\(\\hat y\\) then:\n\\[ \\text{Residual} = \\text{observed} - \\text{predicted} = y - \\hat y\\]\nIt is important for regression modelling that the data are collected in a period when the relationship remains constant. For example, in building a model to predict normal values for lung function the data must be collected when the participants have been resting and not exercising and people taking bronchodilator medications that influence lung capacity should be excluded. In regression, it is not so important that the variables themselves are normally distributed, but it is important that the residuals are. Scatter plots and specific diagnostic tests can be used to check the regression assumptions. Some of these will not be covered in this introductory course but will be discussed in detail in the Regression Methods in Biostatistics course.\nThe distribution of the residuals should always be checked. Large residuals can indicate unusual points or points that may exert undue influence on the estimated regression slope.\nThe histogram of residuals from the model is shown in Figure 8.5. The residuals are approximately normally distributed, with no outlying values.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: Histogram of regression residuals"

    "text": "8.8 Multiple linear regression\nIn the above example, we have only used a simple linear regression model of two continuous variables. Other more complex models can be built from this e.g. if we wanted to look at the effect of gender (male vs. female) as binary indicator in the model while adjusting for the effect of height. In that case we would include both the variables in the model as explanatory variables. In the same way we can include any number of explanatory variables (both continuous and categorical) in the model: this is called a multivariable model. Multivariable models are often used for building predictive equations, for example by using age, height, gender and smoking history to predict lung function, or to adjust for confounding and detect effect modification to investigate the association between an exposure and an outcome factor.\nMultiple regression has an important role in investigating causality in epidemiology. The exposure variable under investigation must stay in the model and the effects of other variables which can be confounders or effect-modifiers are tested. The biological, psychological or social meaning of the variables in the model and their interactions are of great importance for interpreting theories of causality.\nOther multivariable models include binary logistic regression for use with a binary outcome variable, or Cox regression for survival analyses. These models, together with multiple regression, will be taught in PHCM9517: Regression Methods in Biostatistics."

    "text": "9.2 Transforming non-normally distributed variables\nWhen a variable has a skewed distribution, one possibility is to transform the data to a new variable to try and obtain a normal or near normal distribution. Methods to transform non-normally distributed data include logarithmic transformation of each data point, or using the square root or the square or the inverse (i.e. 1/x) etc.\n\n9.2.1 Worked Example\nWe have data from 132 patients who had a hospital stay following admission to ICU available on Moodle (mod09_infection.dta and mod09_infection.rds). The distribution of the length of stay for these patients is shown in the histogram in Figure 9.1. As is common with variables that record time, the data are skewed with many patients having relatively short stays and a few patients having very long hospital stays. Clearly, it would be inappropriate to use parametric statistical methods for these data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Length of hospital stay for 132 patients\n\n\n\n\nWhen data are positively skewed, as shown in Figure 9.1, a logarithmic transformation can often make the data closer to being normally distributed. This is the most common transformation used. You should note, however, that the logarithmic function cannot handle 0 or negative values. One way to deal with zeros in a set of data is to add 1 to each value before taking the logarithm.\nWe would generate a new variable, as shown in the Stata or R notes. As the minimum length of stay in these sample data was 0, we have added 1 to each length of stay before taking the logarithm. The distribution of the logarithm of (length of stay + 1) is shown in Figure 9.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Distribution of log transformed (length of stay + 1)\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution now appears much more bell shaped. Table 9.1 shows the descriptive statistics for length of stay before and after logarithmic transformation. Before transformation, the SD is almost as large as the mean value which indicates that the data are skewed and that these statistics are not an accurate description of the centre and spread of the data.\n\n\nTable 9.1: Summary statistics for untransformed and transformed length of stay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLength of stay\nlog(Length of stay + 1)\n\n\n\n\nMean (Standard deviation)\n38.1 (35.78)\n3.41 (0.715)\n\n\nMean: 95% confidence interval\n31.9 to 44.2\n3.29 to 3.53\n\n\nMedian [Interquartile range]\n27 [21 to 42]\n3.3 [3.1 to 3.8]\n\n\nRange\n0 to 244\n0 to 5.5\n\n\n\n\nThe mean and standard deviation of the transformed length of stay are in log base e (i.e. ln) units. If we raise the mean of the log of length of stay to the power of \\(e\\), it returns a value of 30.2 days (\\(e^{3.41}=30.2\\)).\nTechnically, this is called the geometric mean of the data, and it has a different interpretation to the usual mean, the arithmetic mean. This is a much better estimate in this case of the “average” length of stay than the mean of 38.1 days (95% CI 31.9, 44.2 days) obtained from the non-transformed positively skewed data. Note that, if you have added 1 to your data to deal with 0 values, the back-transformed estimate is approximately equal to the geometric mean.\nThis set of data also includes a variable summarising whether a patient acquired a nosocomial infection (also known as healthcare-associated infections), which are infections that develop while undergoing medical treatment but were absent at the time of admission.\nIf we were testing the hypothesis that there was a difference in length of stay between groups (status of nosocomial infection), t-tests should not be used with length of stay, but could be used for the log transformed variable, which is approximately normally distributed. The output from the t-test of the log-transformed length of stay is shown in Table 9.2. This is done using the t-test shown in Module 5.\n\n\nTable 9.2: Summary statistics for transformed length of stay\n\n\nNosocomial infection\nn\nMean (SE)\n95% Confidence interval\n\n\n\n\nNo\n106\n3.33 (0.068)\n3.19 to 3.46\n\n\nYes\n26\n3.73 (0.136)\n3.45 to 4.01\n\n\nDifference (Yes - No)\n\n0.39 (0.153)\n0.09 to 0.70\n\n\n\n\nHere, a two-sample t-test gives a test statistic of 2.59 with 130 degrees of freedom, and a P-value of 0.01.\nAs explained above, the estimated statistics would need to be converted back to the units in which the variable was measured. From Table 9.2, we can take the exponential of the corresponding log-transformed values:\n\nthe geometric mean of the infected group is approximately 41.5 days with a 95% confidence interval from 31.4 to 55.0 days.\nthe geometric mean of the uninfected group is approximately 27.9 days with a 95% confidence interval from 24.4 to 31.9 days."

For this, non-parametric significance tests can be used but the general idea behind these tests is that the data values are replaced by ranks. This also protects against outliers having too much influence.\n\n9.3.1 Ranking variables\nTable 9.3 shows how ranks are calculated for the first 21 patients in the length-of-stay data. First the data are sorted in order of their magnitude (from the lowest value to the highest) ignoring the group variable. Each data point is then assigned a rank. Data points that are equal are assigned the mean of their ranks. Thus, the two lengths of stay of 11 days share the ranks 4 and 5, and have a mean rank of 4.5. Similarly, there are 5 people with a length of stay of 14 days and these share the ranks 9 to 13, the mean of which is 11. Once ranks are computed they are assigned to each of the two groups and summed within each group.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.3:  Transforming data to ranks (first 21 participants) \n\nIDInfectionLength of stayRankInfection=noInfection=Yes\n\n32No011\n\n33No122\n\n12No933\n\n22No114.54.5\n\n16No114.54.5\n\n28Yes1266\n\n27No137.57.5\n\n20No137.57.5\n\n24No141111\n\n11No141111\n\n130No141111\n\n10No141111\n\n25No141111\n\n19No1515.515.5\n\n30No1515.515.5\n\n23No1515.515.5\n\n14No1515.515.5\n\n15No1720.520.5\n\n13No1720.520.5\n\n21Yes1720.520.5\n\n17No1720.520.5\n\n\n\n\n\nBy assigning ranks to individuals, we lose information about their actual values and this makes it more difficult to detect a difference. However, outliers and extreme values in the data are brought back closer to the data so that they are less influential. For this reason, non-parametric tests have less power than parametric tests and they require much larger differences in the data to show statistical significance between groups."

If this assumption is met, then this test evaluates the null hypothesis that the medians of the two populations are equal. This test does not assume that the populations are normally distributed, nor that their variances are equal.\nConducting the Wilcoxon ranked sum test for our length of stay data yields a P-value of 0.014, providing evidence of a difference in the median length of stay between the groups.\nThis P-value should be provided alongside non-parametric summary statistics such as medians and inter-quartile ranges. In our example, we can obtain the median length of stay values of 24 (Interquartile Range: 19 to 40 days) in the group with no infection and 37 (Interquartile Range: 24 to 50 days) in the group with infection."

    "text": "9.5 Non-parametric test for paired data (Wilcoxon signed-rank test)\nThere are two types of non-parametric tests for paired data, called the Sign test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. In practice, the Sign test is rarely used and will not be discussed in this course.\nIf the differences between two paired measurements are not normally distributed, a non-parametric equivalent of a paired t-test (Module 5) should be used. The equivalent test is the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, also simply called the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. This test is resistant to outliers in the data, however the proportion of outliers in the sample should be small. This test evaluates the null hypothesis that the median of the paired differences is equal to zero.\nIn this test, the absolute differences between the paired scores are ranked and the difference scores that are equal to zero (i.e. scores where there is no difference between the pairs) are excluded. Note that the power of the test (the ability to detect an effect if there truly is an effect) reduces in the presence of zero differences, as the effective sample size (the number of non-zero differences) is reduced.\n\n9.5.1 Worked Example\nA crossover trial is done to compare symptom scores for two drugs in 11 people with arthritis (higher scores indicate more severe symptoms). The data are contained in datafile file mod09_arthritis.csv. The data are shown in Table 9.4.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.4:  Arthritis symptom scores for 11 patients after administering two\ndrugs \n\nPatient IDScore: Drug 1Score: Drug 2Difference (Drug 2 - Drug 1)\n\n1341\n\n2275\n\n3341\n\n48102\n\n5682\n\n661-5\n\n7264\n\n8374\n\n9583\n\n109101\n\n11781\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data shows that there is 1 person who has a negative difference, where the symptom score on drug 2 that is smaller than that for drug 1 (i.e., drug 2 is better than drug 1); and 10 people who have a positive difference. No one has the same score for both drugs.\nBefore doing the analysis let us examine the distribution of the difference of symptom scores between the two drugs. As in Module 5, we first need to compute the difference between the symptom scores. To examine the distribution, we plot a histogram as shown in Figure 9.3.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Distribution of difference in symptom scores between Drug 1 and Drug 2\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram shows that the differences are not normally distributed. The data looks negatively skewed with a gap in the histogram between the values of -5 and 0. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to conduct a paired t-test. Hence, we conduct a non-parametric paired test (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test).\nA non-parametric paired test can be obtained in Stata using the signrank command, or in R using the wilcox.test (specifying paired=TRUE).\nThe P-value obtained from Stata is 0.044, and the P-value obtained from R is 0.049. The reason these two P-values differ is that R uses a so-called “continuity correction” which makes the test more conservative (i.e. makes the test less likely to reject the null-hypothesis when the null-hypothesis is true). In both cases, there is evidence of a difference in symptom scores between the two drugs."

    "text": "9.6 Non-parametric estimates of correlation\nEstimating correlation using Pearson’s correlation coefficient can be problematic when bivariate Normality cannot be assumed, or in the presence of outliers or skewness. There are two commonly used non-parametric alternatives to Pearson’s correlation coefficient: Spearman’s rank correlation (\\(\\rho\\) or rho), and Kendall’s rank correlation (\\(\\tau\\) or tau).\nWhen estimating the correlation between x and y, Spearman’s rank correlation essentially replaces the observations x and y by their ranks, and calculates the correlation between the ranks. Kendall’s rank correlation compares the ranks between every possible combination of pairs of data to measure concordance: whether high values for x tend to be associated with high values for y (positively correlated) or low values of y (negatively correlated).\nIn terms of which is the more appropriate measure to use, the following passage from An Introduction to Medical Statistics (Bland (2015)) provides some guidance:\n\n“Why have two different rank correlation coefficients? Spearman’s \\(\\rho\\) is older than Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\), and can be thought of as a simple analogue of the product moment correlation coefficient, Pearson’s r. Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\) is a part of a more general and consistent system of ranking methods, and has a direct interpretation, as the difference between the proportions of concordant and discordant pairs. In general, the numerical value of \\(\\rho\\) is greater than that of \\(\\tau\\). It is not possible to calculate \\(\\tau\\) from \\(\\rho\\) or \\(\\rho\\) from \\(\\tau\\), they measure different sorts of correlation. \\(\\rho\\) gives more weight to reversals of order when data are far apart in rank than when there is a reversal close together in rank, \\(\\tau\\) does not. However, in terms of tests of significance, both have the same power to reject a false null hypothesis, so for this purpose it does not matter which is used.”\n\nWe will illustrate estimating rank correlation using the data mod08_lung_function.dta or mod08_lung_function.rds, which has information about height and lung function collected from a sample of 120 adults.\nThe Spearman rank correlation coefficient is estimated as 0.75, demonstrating a positive association between height and FVC. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient is estimated as 0.56, again demonstrating a positive association between height and FVC."

Non-parametric methods do not assume any distribution for the data and use significance tests based on ranks or sign (or both). A non-parametric test is always less powerful than its equivalent parametric test if the data are normally distributed and so whenever possible parametric significance tests should be used. In some cases when data are not normally distributed with a reasonably large sample size, the data can be transformed (most commonly by log transformation) to make the distribution normal. A parametric significance test should then be used with the transformed data to test the hypothesis."

In the generate dialog box, type a name for your new variable into the Variable name: box: for example, ln_los. To include the ln function, you can either:\n\nsimply type ln(los + 1) directly into the Specify a value or an expression text box, or;\nclick the Create button to bring up the Expression Builder dialog box. Double click on Functions to expand the list in the Categories box, then click on Mathematical to display the list of mathematical functions in the box on the right.

In the Worked Example 9.1 dataset, the variable infect (presence of nosocomial infection) is a binary categorical variable. To test the hypothesis that patients with nosocomial infection have a different length of stay to patients without infection, you can conduct a t-test on the ln_los variable. You will need to back transform your mean values, as shown in Worked Example 9.1 in the course notes when reporting your results."

    "text": "10.1 Introduction\nDetermining the appropriate sample size (the number of participants in a study) is one of the most critical issues when designing a research study. A common question when planning a project is “How many participants do I need?” The sample size needs to be large enough to ensure that the results can be generalised to the population and will be accurate, but small enough for the study question to be answered with the resources available. In general, the larger the sample size, the more precise the study results will be.\nUnfortunately, estimating the sample size required for a study is not straightforward and the method used varies with the study design and the type of statistical test that will be conducted on the data collected. In the past, researchers calculated the sample size by hand using complicated mathematical formula. More recently, look-up tables have been created which has removed the need for hand calculations. Now, most researchers use computer programs where parameters relevant to the particular study design are entered and the sample size is automatically calculated. In this module, we will use an abbreviated look-up table to demonstrate the parameters that need to be considered when estimating sample sizes for a confidence interval and use software for all other sample size calculations. The look-up table allows you to see at a glance, the impact of different factors on the sample size estimation.\n\n10.1.1 Under and over-sized studies\nIn health research, there are different implications for interpreting the results if the sample size is too small or too large.\nAn under-sized study is one which lacks the power to find an effect or association when, in truth, one exists. If the sample size is too small, an important difference between groups may not be statistically significant and so will not be detected by the study. In fact, it is considered unethical to conduct a health study which is poorly designed so that it is not possible to detect an effect or association if it exists. Often, Ethics Committees request evidence of sample size calculations before a study is approved.\nA classic paper by Freiman et al examined 71 randomised controlled trials which reported an absence of clinical effect between two treatments.(Freiman et al. 1978) Many of the trials were too small to show that a clinically important difference was statistically significant. If the sample size of an analytic study is too small, then only very limited conclusions can be drawn about the results.\nIn general, the larger the sample size the more precise the estimates will be. However, large sample sizes have their own effect on the interpretation of the results. An over-sized study is one in which a small difference between groups, which is not important in clinical or public health terms, is statistically significant. When the study sample is large, the null hypothesis could be rejected in error and research resources may be wasted. This type of study may be unethical due to the unnecessary enrolment of a large number of people."

    "text": "10.2 Sample size estimation for descriptive studies\nTo estimate the sample size required for a descriptive study, we usually focus on specifying the width of the confidence interval around our primary estimate. For example, to estimate the sample size for a study designed to measure a prevalence we need to:\n\nnominate the expected prevalence based on other available evidence;\nnominate the required level of precision around the estimate. For this, the width of the 95% confidence interval (i.e. the distance equal to 1.96 \\(\\times\\) SE) is used.\n\nTable 10.1 is an abbreviated look-up table that we can use to estimate the sample size for this type of study. Note that the sample size required to detect an expected population prevalence of 5% is the same as to detect a prevalence of 95%. Similarly 10% is equivalent to 90% etc. It is symmetric about 50%. From Table 10.1, you can see that the sample size required increases as the expected prevalence approaches 50% and as the precision increases (i.e. the required 95% CI becomes narrower).\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.1:  Sample size required to calculate a 95% confidence interval with a\ngiven precision \n\nWidth of 95% confidence interval (precision)\n\nPrevalence1%1.5%2%2.5%3%3.5%4%5%10%15%\n\n5% or 95%1,825812457292203149115\n\n10% or 90%3,4581,537865554385283217139\n\n15% or 85%4,8992,1771,22578454540030719649\n\n20% or 80%6,1472,7321,5379846835023852466228\n\n25% or 75%7,2033,2021,8011,1538015884512897333\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.1 Worked Example\nA descriptive cross-sectional study is designed to measure the prevalence of bronchitis in children age 0-2 years with a 95% CI of \\(\\pm\\) 4%.

    "text": "10.3 Sample size estimation for analytic studies\nAnalytic study designs are used to compare characteristics between different groups in the population. The main study designs are analytic cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, cohort studies and randomised controlled trials. For analytic study designs, the outcome measure of interest can be a mean value, a proportion or a relative risk if a random sample has been enrolled. For case-control studies the most appropriate measure of association is an odds ratio.\n\n10.3.1 Factors to be considered\nThe first important decision in estimating a required sample size for an analytic study is to select the type of statistical test that will be used to report or analyse the data. Each type of test is associated with a different method of sample size estimation.\nOnce the statistical method has been determined, the following issues need to be decided:\n\nStatistical power: the chance of finding a difference if one exists, e.g. 80%;\nLevel of significance: the P value that will be considered significant, e.g. P&lt;0.05;\nMinimum effect size of interest: the size of the difference between groups e.g. the difference in the proportion of parents who oppose immunisation in two different regions or the difference in mean values of blood pressure in two groups of people with different types of cardiac disease;\nVariability: the spread of the measurements, e.g. the expected standard deviation of the main outcome variable (if continuous), or the expected proportions;\nResources: an estimate of the number of participants available and amount of funding to run the study.\n\nIn addition to deciding the level of power and probability that will be used, the difference between groups that is regarded as being important has to be estimated. The smallest difference between study groups that we want to detect is described as the minimum expected effect size. This is determined on the basis of clinical judgement, public health importance and expertise in the condition being researched, or may it be need to be determined from a pilot study or a literature review. The smaller the expected effect or association, the larger the sample size will need to obtain statistical significance. We also need some knowledge of how variable the measurement is expected to be. For this we often use the standard deviation for a continuous measure. As measurement variability increases, the sample size will need to increase in order to detect the expected difference between the groups. Above all, a study has to be practical in terms of the availability of a population from which to draw sufficient numbers for the study and in terms of the funds that are available to conduct the study.\n\n\n10.3.2 Power and significance level\nThe power of a study, which was discussed in Module 4, is the chance of finding a statistically significant difference when one exists, i.e. the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis. The relationship between the power of a study and statistical significance is shown in Table 10.2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.2:  Comparison of study result with the truth \n\nStudy resultTruth\n\n EffectNo effect\n\nEvidence✓ɑ\n\nNo evidenceβ✓\n\n\n\n\n\nThe power of a study is expressed as 1– β where β is the probability of a false negative (that is, the probability of a Type II error - incorrectly not rejecting the null hypothesis. In most research, power is generally set to 80% (a Type II error rate of 20%). However, in some studies, especially in some clinical trials where rigorous results are required, power is set to 90% (a Type II error rate of 10%).\nThe significance level, or α level, is the level at which the P value of a test is considered to be statistically significant. The α level is usually set at 5% indicating a probability of &lt;0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant. Occasionally, especially if several outcome measures are being compared, the α level is set at 1% indicating a probability of &lt;0.01 will be regarded as statistically significant.\nThe calculation of sample sizes for analytic studies are based on calculations that are somewhat tedious to compute by hand. Software packages are the standard method of calculating sample sizes for these types of study, and examples from both R and Stata will be provided."

    "text": "10.4 Detecting the difference between two means\nThe test that is used to show that two mean values are significantly different from one another is the independent samples t-test (Module 5). The sample size needed for this test to have sufficient power can be calculated using R and Stata as shown in the Worked Example below.\n\n10.4.1 Worked Example\nThere is a hypothesis that the use of the oral contraceptive (OC) pill in premenopausal women can increase systolic blood pressure. A study was planned to test this hypothesis using a two sided t-test. The investigators are interested in detecting an increase of at least 5 mm Hg systolic blood pressure in the women using OC compared to the non-OC users with 90% power at a 5% significance level. A pilot study shows that the SD of systolic blood pressure in the target group is 25 mm Hg and the mean systolic blood pressure of non-OC user women is 110 mm Hg. What is the minimum number of women in each group that need to be recruited for the study to detect this difference?\nSolution The effect size of interest is 5 mm Hg and the associated standard deviation is 25 mm Hg. For power of 90% and alpha of 5%, the sample size calculation using the Stata can be calculated using the power twomeans command:\n\nOutput 10.1: Two independent samples t-test sample size calculation\n\n. power twomeans 110 115, sd(25) power(0.9)\n\nPerforming iteration ...\n\nEstimated sample sizes for a two-sample means test\nt test assuming sd1 = sd2 = sd\nHo: m2 = m1 versus  Ha: m2 != m1\n\nStudy parameters:\n\n        alpha =    0.0500\n        power =    0.9000\n        delta =    5.0000\n           m1 =  110.0000\n           m2 =  115.0000\n           sd =   25.0000\n\nEstimated sample sizes:\n\n            N =     1,054\n  N per group =       527\n\nWe can use the epi.sscompc function within the epiR package in R to calculate the sample size:\n\nlibrary(epiR)\nlibrary(pwr)\n\nepi.sscompc(treat=110, control=115, n=NA, sigma=25, power=0.9)\n\n$n.total\n[1] 1052\n\n$n.treat\n[1] 526\n\n$n.control\n[1] 526\n\n$power\n[1] 0.9\n\n$delta\n[1] 5\n\n\nNote that Stata and R provide slightly different estimated sample sizes. This difference is immaterial from a practical point of view, and highlights the importance of referencing which software package has been used when writing up results.\nFrom the output, we can see that with 90% power we will need 526 or 527 participants in each group, i.e., 1052 or 1054 participants in total.\nIf the above were carried out by taking baseline measures of systolic blood pressure, and then again when the women were taking the OC pills, it would be a matched-pair study. Computing sample sizes for paired studies requires an estimate of the correlation between the paired obervations. If we do not have any estimates for this correlation, we can assume a value of 0. If the correlation is positive, a zero for correlation would give a more conservative estimate of sample size required (i.e. estimate a sample size larger than necessary). While a negative correlation would require a bigger sample size than a zero correlation, it is relatively uncommon to encounter negative correlations between pairs. Any discussions on the effect of correlation on sample size is beyond the scope of this course. Thus, we will always assume a correlation of zero between paired measurements in this course.\nWe can compute the required sample size in Stata using the power pairedmeans command:\n\n\nOutput 10.2: Paired samples t-test sample size using Worked Example 10.2\n\n. power pairedmeans 110 115, corr(0) power(0.9) sd(25)\n\nPerforming iteration ...\n\nEstimated sample size for a two-sample paired-means test\nPaired t test assuming sd1 = sd2 = sd\nHo: d = d0  versus  Ha: d != d0\n\nStudy parameters:\n\n        alpha =    0.0500          ma1 =  110.0000\n        power =    0.9000          ma2 =  115.0000\n        delta =    0.1414           sd =   25.0000\n           d0 =    0.0000         corr =    0.0000\n           da =    5.0000\n         sd_d =   35.3553\n\nEstimated sample size:\n\n            N =       528\n\nAs discussed in the R notes, calculating the sample size required for a paired t-test is a little more cumbersome in R. Here, only the output of the process is provided - refer to the R notes for detail on the code.\n\n\nOutput 10.2: Paired samples t-test sample size using Worked Example 10.2\n\n\n\n     Paired t test power calculation \n\n              n = 527.2954\n              d = 0.1414214\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.9\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number of *pairs*\n\n\nAssuming a correlation of 0 between the two sets of measurements, we can see that we will need 528 pairs of measurements to achieve a power of 90% (virtually the same as for an independent samples study)."

Occasionally, we may not know the expected proportion in one of the groups, e.g. in a randomised control trial of a novel intervention. In the sample size calculation for such a study, we should instead justify the minimum expected difference between the proportions based on what is important from a clinical or public health perspective. Based on the minimum difference, we can then derive the expected proportion for both groups. Note that the smaller the difference, the larger the sample size required.\nThe sample size required in each group to observe a difference in two independent proportions can be calculated using the power twoproportions command in Stata.\n\n10.5.1 Worked Example\nIf we expect that the prevalence of smoking in two comparison groups (e.g. males and females) will be 35% and 20%.

    "text": "10.6 Detecting an association using a relative risk\nThe relative risk is used to describe the association between an exposure and an outcome variable if the sample has been randomly selected from the population. This statistic is often used to describe the effect or association of an exposure in a cross-sectional or cohort study or the effect/association of a treatment in an randomised controlled trial. To estimate the sample size required for the RR to have a statistically significant P value, i.e. to show a significant association, we need to define: - the size of the RR that is considered to be of clinical or public health importance; - the event rate (rate of outcome) among the group who are not exposed to the factor of interest (reference group); - the desired level of significance (usually 0.05); - the desired power of the study (usually 80% or 90%).\nIn general, a RR of 2.0 or greater is considered to be of public health importance, however, a smaller RR can be important when exposure is high. For example, there may be a relatively small risk of respiratory infection among young children with a parent who smokes (RR ~ 1.2). If 25% of children are exposed to smoking in their home, then the high exposure rate leads to a very large number of children who have preventable respiratory infections across the community.\n\n10.6.1 Worked Example\nA study is planned to investigate the effect of an environmental exposure on the incidence of a certain common disease. In the general (unexposed) population the incidence rate of the disease is 50% and it is assumed that the incidence rate would be 75% in the exposed population. Thus the relative risk of interest would be 1.5 (i.e. 0.75 / 0.50). We want to detect this effect with 90% power at a 5% level of significance.\nWe can use the Stata command power twoproportions as below:\n\n10.6.1.1 Output 10.4: Sample size calculation for relative risk\n\nEstimated sample sizes for a two-sample proportions test\nPearson's chi-squared test \nHo: p2 = p1  versus  Ha: p2 != p1\n\nStudy parameters:\n\n        alpha =    0.0500\n        power =    0.9000\n        delta =    1.5000  (relative risk)\n           p1 =    0.5000\n           p2 =    0.7500\n        rrisk =    1.5000\n\nEstimated sample sizes:\n\n            N =       154\n  N per group =        77\n\nFrom Output 10.4, we can see that for a control proportion of 0.5 and RR of 1.5, we need a total sample size of 154, that is 77 people would be needed in each of the exposure groups.\nThe epiR package does not have a function to estimate sample size and power directly for a relative risk, but we can use the epi.sscohortc function. To do this, we recognise that the assumed rate in the exposed group will equal the rate in the unexposed group multiplied by the relative risk.\nHere we define the risk in the unexposed group as 0.5 and the desired relative risk to detect is 1.5.

However, the same parameters are required for the estimation:\n\nthe minimum OR to be considered clinically important;\nthe proportion of exposed among the control group;\nthe desired level of significance (usually 0.05);\nthe desired power of the study (usually 80% or 90%).\n\n\n10.7.1 Worked Example\nA case-control study is designed to examine an association between an exposure and outcome factor. Existing literature shows that 30% of the controls are expected to be exposed. We want to detect a minimum OR of 2.0 with 90% power and 5% level of significance.\n\n. power twoproportions .3, test(chi2) oratio(2) power(0.9)\nEstimated sample sizes for a two-sample proportions test\nPearson's chi-squared test \nHo: p2 = p1  versus  Ha: p2 != p1\n\nStudy parameters:\n\n        alpha =    0.0500\n        power =    0.9000\n        delta =    2.0000  (odds ratio)\n           p1 =    0.3000\n           p2 =    0.4615\n   odds ratio =    2.0000\n\nEstimated sample sizes:\n\n            N =       376\n  N per group =       188\n\nWe can use the epi.sscc function in R to calculate a sample size based on an odds ratio in a case-control study:\n\nepi.sscc(OR=2, p0=0.3, n=NA, power=0.9)\n\n$n.total\n[1] 376\n\n$n.case\n[1] 188\n\n$n.control\n[1] 188\n\n$power\n[1] 0.9\n\n$OR\n[1] 2\n\n\nWe find that 188 controls and 188 cases are required i.e. a total of 376 participants.\nThis sample size would be smaller if we increased the effect size (OR) or reduced the study power to 80%.

    "text": "10.8 Factors that influence power\n\n10.8.1 Dropouts\nIt is common to increase estimated sample sizes to allow for drop-outs or non-response. To account for drop-outs, the estimated sample size can be divided by (1 minus the dropout rate). Consider the following case:\n\nn-completed: the number who will complete the study (i.e. n after drop-out)\nn-recruited: the number who should be recruited (i.e. n before drop-out)\nd: drop-out rate (as a proportion - i.e. a number between 0 and 1)\n\nThen n-completed = n-recruited × (1 - d)\nRe-arranging this formula gives: n-recruited = n-completed ÷ (1 - d).\n\n\n10.8.2 Unequal groups\nMany factors that come into play in a study can reduce the estimated power of a study. In clinical trials, it is not unusual for recruitment goals to be much harder to achieve than expected and therefore for the target sample size to be impossible to realise within the timeframe planned for recruitment.\nIn case-control studies, the number of potential case participants available may be limited but study power can be maintained by enrolling a greater number of controls than cases. Or in an experimental study, more participants may be randomised to the new treatment group to test its effects accurately when much is known about the effect of standard care and a more precise estimate of the new treatment effect is required.\nHowever, there is a trade-off between increasing the ratio of group size and the total number that needs to be enrolled. Consider Worked Example @ref(wex10-5): selecting an equal number of controls and cases would require 188 cases and 188 controls, a total of 376 participants.\nWe may want to reduce the number of cases required, by selecting 2 controls for every case. Selecting 2 controls (N1) per case (N2) (corresponding to a ratio of N2/N1 of 0.5) would require 140 cases and 280 controls, a total of 420 participants. We can extend this example and investigate the impact of changing the ratio of controls per case.\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing the number of controls per case\nControls per caseAllocation ratio (N2/N1)     Number of cases requiredNumber of controls requiredTotal participants required\n\n11     188188376\n\n20.5   140280420\n\n30.3333124371495\n\n40.25  116462578\n\n50.2   111553664\n\n60.1666108644752\n\n70.1429105734839\n\n80.125 104825929\n\n90.11111029161,018\n\n100.1   1011,0061,107\n\n\n\n\nThis can be visualised graphically, as in Figure 10.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Increasing the number of controls per case\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the number of cases required drops off if we go from 1 to 2 controls per case, and again from 2 to 3 controls per case. Once we go from 3 to 4 controls per case, we only reduce the number of cases by 8 (124 vs 116 cases), but at an increase of 91 (371 vs 462) controls. Clearly, this reduction in cases is not offset by the extra controls required.\nIn Stata, the allocation ratio is the number in the experimental group / the number in the control group. There is some inconsistency in R, which as of May 2023, leads to inconsistent results between Stata and R for case-control studies with unequal group sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStata\nR\n\n\n\n\nDifference in means\nratio = n-exposed / n-controls\nratio = n-exposed / n-unexposed\n\n\nDifference in proportions\nratio = n-exposed / n-controls\nratio = n-exposed / n-unexposed\n\n\nRelative risk\nratio = n-exposed / n-controls\nratio = n-exposed / n-unexposed\n\n\nOdds ratio\nratio = n-cases / n-controls\nratio = n-controls / n-cases"

    "text": "10.9 Limitations in sample size estimations\nIn this module we have seen how to use Stata for estimating the sample size requirement of a study given the statistical test that will be used and the expected characteristics of the sample. However, once a study is underway, it is not unusual for sample size to be compromised by the lack of research resources, difficulties in recruiting participants or, in a clinical trial, participants wanting to change groups when information about the new experimental treatment rapidly becomes available in the press or on the internet.\nOne approach that is increasingly being used is to conduct a blinded interim analysis say when 50% of the total data that are planned have been collected. In this, a statistician external to the research team who is blinded to the interpretation of the group code is asked to measure the effect size in the data with the sole aim of validating the sample size requirement. It is rarely a good idea to use an interim analysis to reduce the planned sample size and terminate a trial early because the larger the sample size, the greater the precision with which the treatment effect is estimated. However, interim analyses are useful for deciding whether the sample size needs to be increased in order to answer the study question and avoid a Type II error."

    "text": "10.10 Summary\nIn this module we have discussed the importance of conducting a clinical or epidemiological study with enough participants so that an effect or association can be identified if it exists (i.e. study power), and how this has to be balanced by the need to not enrol more participants than necessary because of resource issues. We have looked at the parameters that need to be considered when estimating the sample size for different studies and have used a look-up table to estimate required sample size for a prevalence study and Stata to estimate appropriate sample sizes in epidemiological research under the most straightforward situations. The common requirement in all the situations is that the researchers need to specify the minimum effect measure (e.g. difference in means, OR, RR etc) they want to detect with a given probability (usually 80% to 90%) at a certain level of significance (usually P&lt;0.05). The ultimate decision on the sample size depends on a compromise among different objectives such as power, minimum effect size, and available resources. To make the final decision, it is helpful to do some trial calculations using revised power and the minimum detectable effect measure."
