    "section": "2.1 Introduction",
    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nIn Module 4, a one-sample t-test was used for comparing a single mean to a hypothesised value. In health research, we often want to compare the means between two groups. For example, in an observational study, we may want to compare cholesterol levels in people who exercise regularly to the levels in people who do not exercise regularly. In a clinical trial, we may want to compare cholesterol levels in people who have been randomised to a dietary modification or to usual care. In this module, we show how to compare the means of two groups where the analysis variable is normally distributed.\nFrom the decision tree presented in the Appendix, we can see that if we have a continuous outcome measure and two categorical groups that are not related, i.e. a binary exposure measurement, the test for such data is an independent samples t-test. The test is also sometimes called a 2-sample t-test.\nIn research, data are often ‘paired’ or ‘matched’, that is the two data points are related to one another. This occurs when measurements are taken:\n\nFrom each participant on two occasions, e.g. at baseline and follow-up in an experimental study or in a longitudinal cohort study;\nFrom related people, e.g. a mother and daughter or a child and their sibling;\nFrom related sites in the same person, e.g. from both limbs, eyes or kidneys;\nFrom matched participants e.g. in a matched case-control study;\nIn cross-over clinical trials where the patient receives both drugs, often in random order.\n\nAn independent samples t-test cannot be used for analysing paired or matched data because the assumption that the two groups are independent is violated. Treating paired or matched measurements as independent samples would artificially inflate the sample size and lead to inaccurate P values. When the data are related in a paired or matched way and the outcome is continuous, a paired t-test is the appropriate statistic to use if the data are normally distributed."

    "section": "2.2 Independent samples t-test",
    "text": "2.2 Independent samples t-test\nAn independent samples t-test is a parametric test that is used to assess whether the mean values of two groups are different from one another. Thus, the test is used to assess whether two mean values are similar enough to have come from the same population or whether the difference between them is so large that the two groups can be considered to have come from separate populations with different characteristics.\nThe null hypothesis is that the mean values of the two groups are not different, that is:\nH0: (\\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\)) = 0\nRejecting the null hypothesis using an independent samples t-test indicates that the difference between the means of the two groups is large in relation to the variability in the samples and is unlikely to be due to chance or to sampling variation.\n\n2.2.1 Assumptions for an independent samples t-test\nThe assumptions that must be met before an independent samples t-test can be used are:\n\nThe two groups are independent\nThe measurements are independent\nThe analysis variable must be continuous and must be normally distributed in each group\n\nThe first two assumptions are determined by the study design. The two samples must be independent, i.e. if a person is in one group then they cannot be included in the other group, and the measurements within a sample must be independent, i.e. each person must be included in their group once only.\nThe third assumption of normality is important although t-tests are robust to some degree of non-normality as long as there are no influential outliers and, more importantly, if the sample size is large. We examined how to assess normality in Module 2. If the data are not normally distributed, it may be possible to transform them using a mathematical function such as a logarithmic transformation. If not, then we may need to use non-parametric tests. This is examined in Module 9.\nTraditionally, the variance of the analysis variable in each group was assumed to be equal. However, this assumption can be relaxed by using Welch’s variation of the t-test. It has been recommended that this unequal-variances t-test be used in most, if not all situations (West 2021; delacre17?; Ruxton 2006)\n\n\n2.2.2 Worked Example\nIn an observational study of a random sample of 100 full term babies from the community, birth weight and gender were measured. There were 44 male babies and 56 female babies in the sample. The research question asked whether there was a difference in birth weights between boys and girls. The two groups are independent of each other and therefore an independent samples t-test can be used to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in weight between the genders.\nSome preliminary descriptive statistics of the distribution of the variable of interest in each group should always be obtained before a t-test is undertaken to ensure that the assumptions are met. Box plots and histograms are ideal for this. Histrograms and box plots of the data obtained in Stata using Graphics &gt; Box plot is shown in Figure 2.1. The datasets mod05_birthweight.dta and mod05_birthweight.rds are available on Moodle.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Histograms and box plots of birth weight by gender\n\n\n\n\nThe plots show that the data are approximately normally distributed: the histograms are relatively bell shaped and symmetric, and the boxes are fairly symmetrical, there are no outliers, and the spread is similar in both groups as the similar length of the whiskers suggesting that the variance is equal between groups.\nWe can also describe the data using summary statistics:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Summary of birthweight by gender\n\n\nCharacteristic\nFemale\nMale\n\n\nBirthweight\n\n\n\n\nN\n56\n44\n\n\nMean (SD)\n3.59 (0.36)\n3.42 (0.35)\n\n\nMedian (IQR)\n3.53 (3.33, 3.87)\n3.43 (3.16, 3.63)\n\n\nRange\n2.95, 4.25\n2.75, 4.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table shows that girls have a mean weight of 3.59 kg (SD 0.36) and boys have a mean weight of 3.42 kg (SD 0.35) with females being heavier than males. The variabilities of birth weight, as indicated by the standard deviations, are similar.\n\n\n2.2.3 Conducting and interpreting an independent samples t-test\nAn independent samples t-test provides us with a t statistic from which we can compute a P value. The computation of the t statistic is as follows:\n\\[t = \\frac{{\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2}}{SE({\\overline{x}}_{1} - {\\overline{x}}_{2})}\\]\nwith the standard error and degrees of freedom calculated from software. Note that by using Welch’s t-test, the degrees of freedom will usually not be a whole number, and will appear with decimals.\nLooking at the formula for the t-statistic, we can see that the \\(t\\) is an estimate of how different the mean values are compared to the variability of the difference in means. So \\(t\\) will become larger as the difference in means increases with respect to the variability.\nStatistical software will calculate both the t and P values. If the t-value is large, the P value will be small, providing evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups.\nTable 2.2 summarises the results of an independent samples t-test using mod05_birthweight.dta or mod05_birthweight.rds. The process of conducting the t-test is summarised for Stata and R in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Birthweight (kg) by sex\n\n\nSex\nn\nMean (SE)\n95% Confidence Interval\n\n\nFemale\n56\n3.59 (0.049)\n3.49 to 3.68\n\n\nMale\n44\n3.42 (0.053)\n3.31 to 3.53\n\n\nDifference\n\n0.17 (0.072)\n0.02 to 0.31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see that girls are heavier than boys, and the mean difference in weights between the genders is 0.17 kg (95% CI 0.02, 0.31). We are 95% confident that the true mean difference of weight between girls and boys lies between 0.02 and 0.31 kg. Note that this interval does not contain the null value of 0.\nHere we are testing the null hypothesis of no difference in mean birthweights between females and males: a two-sided test. The t-value is calculated as 2.30 with 93.5 degrees of freedom, and yields a two-sided P value of 0.023, providing evidence of a difference in mean birthweight between sex."

    "text": "2.3 Paired t-tests\nIf the outcome of interest is the difference in the continuously outcome measurement between each pair of observations, a paired t-test is used. In effect, a paired t-test is used to assess whether the mean of the differences between the two related measurements is significantly different from zero. In this sense, a paired t-test is very closely aligned with a one sample t-test.\nWhen using a paired t-test, the variation between the pairs of measurements is the most important statistic. The variation between the participants is of little interest.\nFor related measurements, the data for each pair of values must be entered on the same row of the spreadsheet. Thus, the number of rows in the data sheet is the number of pairs of observations. Thus, the effective sample size is the total number of pairs and not the total number of measurements.\n\n2.3.1 Assumptions for a paired t-test\nThe assumptions for a paired t-test are:\n\nthe outcome variable is continuous\nthe differences between the pair of the measurements are normally distributed\n\nFor a paired samples t-test, it is important to test whether the differences between the two measurements are normally distributed. If the assumptions for a paired t-test cannot be met, a non-parametric equivalent is a more appropriate test to use (Module 9).\n\n\n2.3.2 Computing a paired t-test\nThe null hypothesis for using a paired t-test is as follows:\nH0: Mean (Measurement1 – Measurement2) = 0\nTo compute a t-value, the size of the mean difference between the two measurements is compared to the standard error of the paired differences, i.e.\n\\[t = \\frac{\\overline{d}}{SE(\\overline{d})}\\]\nwith n–1 degrees of freedom, where n is the number of pairs.\nBecause the standard error becomes smaller as the sample size becomes larger, the t-value increases as the sample size increases for the same mean difference.\n\n\n2.3.3 Worked Example 5.2\nA total of 107 people were recruited into a study to assess whether ankle blood pressure measured in two different sites would be the same. For each person, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured in two sites: dorsalis pedis and tibialis posterior.\nThe dataset mod05_ankle_bp.xls is available on Moodle. First, we need to compute the pairwise difference between SBP measured in the two sites in Stata using the generate command. This is shown in the Stata manual at the end of this module (Checking the assumptions for a Paired t-test). The distribution of the difference between SBP measured in dorsalis pedis and tibialis posterior is shown in Figure 2.2. The differences approximate a normal distribution and therefore a paired t-test can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Distribution of differences in ankle SBP between two sites of 107 participants\n\n\n\n\nThe paired t-test can be performed using statistical software, with a summary of the results presented in Table 2.3. We can see that the mean SBP is very similar in the two sites.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) measured at two sites on the ankle\n\n\nSite\nn\nMean (SE)\n95% Confidence Interval\n\n\nDorsalis pedis\n107\n116.7 (3.46)\n(109.9 to 123.6)\n\n\nTibialis posterior\n107\n118.0 (3.43)\n(111.2 to 124.8)\n\n\nDifference\n107\n-1.3 (1.31)\n(-3.9 to 1.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe t-value is calculated as −0.96 with 106 degrees of freedom, providing a two-sided P-value of 0.34. Thus these data provide no evidence of a difference in systolic blood pressure between the two sites."

While RStudio allows browsing a data set as a spreadsheet, it will not let a user replace an observation with a missing value: this should be done using code.\nA missing value in R is denoted NA, and this is consistent for any variable type: continuous, string (i.e. character) and even a factor.\nRecall the weights data used in Module 2.

    "section": "3.2 Calculating proportions and 95% confidence intervals",
    "text": "3.2 Calculating proportions and 95% confidence intervals\n\n3.2.1 Calculating a proportion\nWe need two pieces of information to calculate a proportion: \\(n\\), the number of trials, and \\(k\\), the number of ‘successes’. Note that we use the term ‘success’ to describe the outcome of interest, recognising that a success may be a adverse outcome such as death or disease.\nThe following formula is used to calculate the proportion, \\(p\\):\n\\[ p = k / n \\]\nThe proportion, \\(p\\), is a number that lies between 0 and 1. Proportions and their confidence intervals can easily be converted to percentages by multiplying by 100 once computed.\nAs for all summary statistics, it is useful to compute the precision of the estimate as a 95% confidence interval (CI) to indicate the range of values in which are 95% confident that the true population value lies. In this module, we present two methods for computing a 95% confidence interval around a proportion.\n\n\n3.2.2 Calculating the 95% confidence interval of a proportion (Wald method)\nThe Wald method for calculating the 95% confidence interval is based on assuming that the proportion, \\(p\\), is Normally distributed. This assumption is reasonable if the sample is sufficiently large (for example, if \\(n&gt;30\\)) and if \\(n \\times (1-p)\\) and \\(n \\times p\\) are both larger than 5.\nThe Wald method for calculating a 95% confidence interval is given by:\n\\[\\text{95\\% CI} = p \\pm (1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(p))\\]\nwhere the standard error of a proportion is computed as:\n\\[\\text{SE}(p) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p \\times (1 - p)}{n}}\\]\n\n\n3.2.3 Worked Example 6.1\nIn a cross-sectional study of children living in a rural village, 47 children from a random sample of 215 children were found to have scabies. Here \\(n=215\\) and \\(k=47\\), so the proportion of children with scabies is estimated as:\n\\[ p = \\frac{47}{215} = 0.2186 \\]\nGiven the large sample size and the number of children with the rarer outcome is larger than 5, the Wald method is used to calculate the standard error of the proportion as:\n\\[{\\text{SE}\\left( p \\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2186 \\times (1 - 0.2186)}{215}}\n}{= 0.02819}\\]\nThen, the 95% confidence interval is estimated as:\n\\[\\text{95\\% CI} = 0.2816 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.02819\\]\n\\[= 0.1634 \\text{ to } 0.2739\\]\nThe prevalence of scabies among children in the village is 21.9% (95% CI 16.3%, 27.4%). These values tell us that we are 95% confident that the true prevalence of scabies among children in the village is between 16.3% and 27.4%.\n\n\n3.2.4 Calculating the 95% confidence interval of a proportion (Wilson method)\nAnother method to calculate the confidence interval of a proportion is the Wilson (sometimes also called the ‘score’) method. We can use it in situations where it is not appropriate to use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution as described above i.e. if the sample size is small (\\(n &lt; 30\\)) or the number of subjects with the rarer outcome is 5 or fewer. This method much more difficult to implement by hand than the standard confidence interval, and so we will not discuss the hand calculation using the mathematical equation in this course. Instead, we use statistical software to do this (see the Stata or R notes for detail).\nWhen using software, our worked example provides a 95% confidence interval of the prevalence of scabies of 16.9% to 27.9%.\n\n\n3.2.5 Wald vs Wilson methods\nThe Wald method, which assumes that the underlying proportion follows a Normal distribution, is easy to calculate and follows the form of other confidence intervals. The Wilson method, which is difficult to calculate by hand, has nicer mathematical properties. There are also a number of other methods for calculating confidence intervals for proportions, but we do not discuss these in this course.\nA paper by Brown, Cai and DasGupta (Brown, Cai, and DasGupta (2001)) has compared the properties of the Wald and Wilson methods (among others) and concluded that the Wilson method is preferred over the Wald method. Therefore, we recommend the Wilson method be used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for a proportion."

    "section": "3.3 Hypothesis testing for one sample proportion",
    "text": "3.3 Hypothesis testing for one sample proportion\nWe can carry out a hypothesis test to compare a sample proportion to a hypothesised proportion. In much the same way as a one sample t-test was used in Module 5 to test a sample mean against a hypothesised mean, we can perform a one-sample test to test a sample proportion against a hypothesised proportion. The significance test will provide a P-value to assess the evidence against the null hypothesis, while the 95% confidence interval will provide the range in which we are 95% confident that the true proportion lies.\nFor example, we can test the following null hypothesis:\nH0: sample proportion is not different from the hypothesised proportion\nMuch like constructing a 95% confidence interval, there are two main options when performing a hypothesis test on a single proportion: the first assumes that the proportion follows a Normal distribution, while the second relaxes this assumption.\n\n3.3.1 z-test for testing one sample proportion\nThe first step in the z-test is to calculate a z-statistic, which is then used to calculate a P-value. The z-statistic is calculated as the difference between the population proportion and the sample proportion divided by the standard error of the population proportion, i.e.\n\\[\nz = \\frac{(p_{sample} - p_{population})}{\\text{SE}(p_{population})}\n\\]\nThis z-statistic is then compared to the standard Normal distribution to calculate the P-value.\n\n\n3.3.2 Worked Example 6.2\nA national census in a country shows that 20% of the population are smokers. A survey of a community within the country that has received a public health anti-smoking intervention shows that 54 of 300 people sampled are smokers (18%). We can calculate a 95% confidence interval around this proportion using the Wilson method, which is calculated as 14.1% to 22.7%.\nThe researchers are interested in whether the proportion of smoking in this community is the same as the population prevalence of smoking of 20%. The null hypothesis can be written as: H0: the proportion of smokers in the community is 20% (the same as in the national census).\nWe can test this by calculating a z-statistic:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nz &= \\frac{(0.18 - 0.20)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.20 × (1 - 0.20)}{300}}} \\\\\n&= -0.87\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe P-value for the test above can be obtained from a Normal distribution table as \\(P = 2 × 0.192 = 0.38\\) (using Table A2.1 in the Appendix), or using the hand-calculator in Stata. This indicates that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is a difference between the proportion of smokers in the community and the country. This is consistent with our 95% confidence interval which crosses the null value of 20%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Binomial test for testing one sample proportion\nWe can use the binomial distribution to obtain an exact P-value for testing a single proportion. Historically, this was a time consuming process with much hand calculation. These days, statistical software performs the calculations quickly and efficiently, and is the preferred method.\n\n\n3.3.4 Worked example 6.3\nThe file mod06_smoking_status.csv contains the data for this example. In the data file, smokers are coded as 1 and non-smokers are coded as 0.\nIn Stata, we can use the prtest command to perform a z-test, or the bitest command to perform the exact binomial test. In R, we can use the prop.test function to perform a z-test, or the binom.test function to perform the exact binomial test.\nThe z-test provides a two-sided P-value of 0.39, while the binomial test gives a two-sided P-value of 0.43. Both tests provide little evidence against the hypothesis that the prevalence of smoking in the community is 20%."

This coding ensures that measures of association, such as the odds ratio or relative risk, are computed correctly by Stata. While R does not require this coding to be followed, it is good practice nonetheless."

This topic is covered in much more detail in PHCM9794: Foundations of Epidemiology, and more detail can be found in Chapter 4 of Essential Epidemiology (3rd or 4th edition) Webb, Bain and Page (Webb, Bain, and Page (2016)).\n\n3.5.1 Randomised controlled trial\nA randomised controlled trial addresses the research question: what is the effect of an intervention on an outcome. In the simplest form of a randomised controlled trial, a group of participants is randomly allocated to a group that receives the treatment of interest or to a control group that does not receive the treatment of interest. Participants are followed up over time, and the outcome is measured at the conclusion of the study.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design of a randomised controlled trial [Figure 4.1, Essential Epidemiology]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Cohort study\nA cohort study is an observational study that addresses the research question: what is the effect of an exposure on an outcome. This research question is similar to that studied in a randomised controlled trial, but the exposure is defined by the participants’ circumstances, and not manipulated by the researchers. In a cohort study, participants without the outcome of interest are enrolled, followed over time, and information on their exposure to a factor is measured (either at baseline or over time). At the conclusion of the study, information on the outcome is measured to identify new (incident) cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design of a cohort study [Figure 4.2, Essential Epidemiology]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Case control study\nWhile the randomised controlled trial and cohort study begin with a population without the outcome, a case-control study begins by assembling a group with the outcome of interest (cases), and a group without the outcome of interest (controls).

    "text": "3.6 Measures of effect for epidemiological studies\nWe can calculate a relative measure of association between an exposure and an outcome as either a relative risk or odds ratio. The relative risk is a direct comparison of the risk in the exposed group with the risk in the non-exposed group, and can only be calculated for a cohort study (including a randomised controlled trial) or a cross-sectional study (where it is also called a prevalence ratio).\nFor cohort studies, randomised controlled trials and cross-section studies, we can calculate an absolute measure of association between an exposure and an outcome as a difference in proportions (also known as an attributable risk).\nFor case-control studies, as we sample participants based on their outcome, we can not estimate the risk of the outcome. Hence, calculating a relative risk or risk difference is inappropriate. Instead of calculating risks in a case-control study, we instead calculate odds, where the odds of an event are calculated as the number with the event divided by the number without the event.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: Contingency table for a case-control study\n\n\n\nCases\nControls\nTotal\n\n\nExposure present\na\nb\na+b\n\n\nExposure absent\nc\nd\nc+d\n\n\nTotal\na+c\nb+d\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example in Table Table 3.3, we can calculate the odds of being exposed in the cases as \\(a \\div c\\). Similarly, we can calculate the odds of being exposed in the controls as \\(b \\div d\\). We can the calculate the odds ratio as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Odds ratio} &= (a \\div c) \\div (b \\div d) \\\\\n&= \\frac{a \\times d}{b \\times c} \\\\\n&= \\frac{ad}{bc}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that some authors say we should think of the odds ratio being based on the odds of being a case in the exposed group compared to the odds of being a case in the unexposed group. Here, the exposed group comprises cells “a” and “b”, so the odds of being a case in the exposed group is (a/b). Similarly, for the unexposed group, the odds of being exposed is (c/d). So our odds ratio becomes (a/b) / (c/d). If we rearrange this, we get the same odds ratio as above: (ad)/(bc).\nThe interpretation of an odds ratio is discussed in detail in PHCM9794: Foundations of Epidemiology, and an excerpt is presented here: The meaning of the calculated odds ratio as a measure of association between exposure and outcome is the same as for the rate ratio (relative risk) where:\n\nAn odds ratio &gt;1 indicates that exposure is positively associated with disease (i.e. the exposure may be a cause of disease);\nAn odds ratio &lt; 1 indicates that exposure is negatively associated with disease (i.e. the exposure may be protective against disease); and\nAn odds ratio = 1 indicates no association between the exposure and the outcome.\n\nIn some situations, related to how well controls are recruited into this study, the odds ratio is a close approximation of the relative risk. Therefore, you may see in some published papers of case control studies the OR interpreted as you would interpret a RR. This should be avoided in this course.\nMore information about the problems of interpreting odds-ratios as relative risks has been presented by Deeks (1998) and Schmidt and Kohlmann (2008).\n\n3.6.1 Worked Example 6.4\nA randomised controlled trial was conducted among a group of patients to estimate the side effects of a drug. Fifty patients were randomly allocated to receive the active drug and 50 patients were allocated to receive a placebo drug. The outcome measured was the experience of nausea. The data is given in the files mod06_nausea.dta and mod06_nausea.rds.\nA summary table can be constructed as in Table 3.4.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.4: Nausea status by drug exposure\n\n\n\nNausea\nNo nausea\nTotal\n\n\nActive drug\n15\n35\n50\n\n\nPlacebo\n4\n46\n50\n\n\nTotal\n19\n81\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use Stata or R to calculate the relative risk (RR=3.75) and its 95% confidence interval (1.34 to 10.51). This tells us that nausea is 3.75 times more likely to occur in the active drug group compared with the placebo group. Because this is a randomised controlled trial, the relative risk would be an appropriate measure of association.\nWe can confirm the estimated relative risk:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{RR} &= \\frac{a / (a+b)}{c / (c+d)} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{15 / (15+35)}{4 / (4+46)} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{0.3}{0.08} \\\\\n  &= 3.75\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n3.6.2 Worked Example 6.5\nA case-control study investigated the association between human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer (D'Souza, et al. NEJM 2007), and the results appear in Table 3.5.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.5: Association between human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer\n\n\n\nCases\nControls\nTotal\n\n\n\n(Oropharyngeal cancer)\n(No oropharyngeal cancer)\n\n\n\nHPV Positive\n57\n14\n71\n\n\nHPV Negative\n43\n186\n229\n\n\nTotal\n100\n200\n300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe odds ratio is the odds of being HPV positive in cases (those with oropharyngeal cancer) compared to the odds of being HPV positive in the controls (those without oropharyngeal cancer):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{OR} &= \\frac{a / c}{b /d} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{57 / 43}{14 / 186} \\\\\n  &= 17.6\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can use Stata or R to estimate the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. We should use the Cornfield option in Stata to provide a better estimate of the 95% confidence interval. It appears that the jmv package in R does not use the Cornfield approximation to estimate the 95% confidence interval, but uses the Woolf method.\nThe odds ratio is estimated as 17.6, and its 95% confidence interval is estimated 9.0 to 34.3 (Cornfield, using Stata) or 9.0 to 34.5 (Woolf, using R).\nThe interpretation of the confidence intervals for both the relative risk and the odds ratio is the same as for the confidence intervals around other summary measures in that it shows the region in which we are 95% confident that the true population estimate lies."

Notice the order in which the factor levels are presented: group has the Placebo level defined as the first level, and the Active level defined as the second; side_effect has No nausea defined as the first level, and the Nausea level defined as the second.\nWe will use jmv to calculate relative risks, odds ratios and risk differences. To calculate these estimates correctly, we must define the positive exposure and positive outcome to be the first level of a factor. When defining an exposure for example, we should define the active treatment or the positive exposure as the first category. When defining an outcome, we should define the category of interest (e.g. disease, or side effect) as the first category.\nIn this example, we will define Active as the first level in the group factor, and Nausea to be the first level of the side_effect factor.\nWe can do this using the relevel() function, which re-orders the levels of a factor so that the level specified is defined as the first level, and the others are moved down:\n\n# Define \"Active\" as the first level of group:\ndrug$group &lt;- relevel(drug$group, ref=\"Active\")\n\n\n# Define \"Nausea\" as the first level of side_effect:\ndrug$side_effect &lt;- relevel(drug$side_effect, ref=\"Nausea\")\n\nUpon re-leveling the factors, we can check that the levels of interest have been defined as the first levels:\n\nsummary(drug)\n\n     group       side_effect\n Active :50   Nausea   :19  \n Placebo:50   No nausea:81  \n\n\nTo construct the 2-by-2 table and calculate a relative risk, we use the contTables() function in jmv.

Here we must define the levels in the order we want the categories to appear in the table. Note that as group and side_effect are entered as text variables, we can omit labels command when defining the factors, and the factor will be labelled using the text entry:\n\ndrug_aggregated$group &lt;- factor(drug_aggregated$group, \n                                levels=c(\"Active\", \"Placebo\"))\n\ndrug_aggregated$side_effect &lt;- factor(drug_aggregated$side_effect, \n                                      levels=c(\"Nausea\", \"No nausea\"))\n\nWe can calculate the relative risk using the summarised data in the same was done previously.

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nIn Module 5, we saw how to test whether the means from two groups are equal - in other words, whether a continuous variable is related to a categorical variable. Sometimes we are interested in how closely two continuous variables are related. For example, we may want to know how closely blood cholesterol levels are related to dietary fat intake in adult men. To measure the strength of association between two continuously distributed variables, a correlation coefficient is used.\nWe may also want to predict a value of a continuous measurement from another continuous measurement. For example, we may want to know predict values of lung capacity from height in a community of adults. A regression model allows us to use one measurement to predict another measurement.\nAlthough both correlation coefficients and regression models can be used to describe the degree of association between two continuous variables, the two methods provide different information. It is important to note that both methods summarise the strength of an association between variables, and do not imply a causal relationship."

    "section": "4.3 Correlation",
    "text": "4.3 Correlation\nWe use correlation to measure the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. Before calculating a correlation coefficient, a scatter plot should first be obtained to give an understanding of the nature of the relationship between the two variables.\n\n4.3.1 Worked Example\nThe file mod08_lung_function.csv has information about height and lung function collected from a random sample of 120 adults. Information was collected on height (cm) and lung function, which was measured as forced vital capacity (FVC), measured in litres. We can obtain a scatter-plot shown in Figure 4.1, where the outcome variable (\\(y\\)) is plotted on the vertical axis, and the explanatory variable (\\(x\\)) is plotted on the horizontal axis.\nFigure 4.1 shows that as height increases, lung function also increases, which is as expected. One or two of the data points are separated from the rest of the data but are not so far away as to be considered outliers because they do not seem to stand out of other observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Association between height and lung function in 120 adults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Correlation coefficients\nA correlation coefficient (r) describes how closely the variables are related, that is the strength of linear association between two continuous variables. The range of the coefficient is from +1 to −1 where +1 is a perfect positive association, 0 is no association and −1 is a perfect inverse association. In general, an absolute (disregarding the sign) r value below 0.3 indicates a weak association, 0.3 to &lt; 0.6 is fair association, 0.6 to &lt; 0.8 is a moderate association, and \\(\\ge\\) 0.8 indicates a strong association.\nThe correlation coefficient is positive when large values of one variable tend to occur with large values of the other, and small values of one variable (y) tend to occur with small values of the other (x) (Figure 4.2 (a and b)). For example, height and weight in healthy children or age and blood pressure.\nThe correlation coefficient is negative when large values of one variable tend to occur with small values of the other, and small values of one variable tend to occur with large values of the other (Figure 4.2 (c and d)). For example, percentage immunised against infectious diseases and under-five mortality rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Scatter plots demonstrating strong and weak, positive and negative associations\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to calculate a P-value associated with a correlation coefficient to test whether the correlation coefficient is different from zero. However, a correlation coefficient with a large P-value does not imply that there is no relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), because the correlation coefficient only tests for a linear association and there may be a non-linear relationship such as a curved or irregular relationship.\nThe assumptions for using a Pearson’s correlation coefficient are that:\n\nobservations are independent;\nboth variables are continuous variables;\nthe relationship between the two variables is linear.\n\nThere is a further assumption that the data follow a bivariate normal distribution. This assumes: y follows a normal distribution for given values of x; and x follows a normal distribution for given values of y. This is quite a technical assumption that we do not discuss further.\nThere are two types of correlation coefficients– the correct one to use is determined by the nature of the variables as shown in Table 4.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Correlation coefficients and their application\n\n\nCorrelation coefficient\nApplication\n\n\nPearson’s correlation coefficient: r\nBoth variables are continuous and a bivariate normal distribution can be assumed\n\n\nSpearman’s rank correlation: rho\nBivariate normality cannot be assumed. Also useful when at least one of the variables is ordinal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpearman’s \\(\\rho\\) is calculated using the ranks of the data, rather than the actual values of the data. We will see further examples of such methods in Module 9, when we consider non-parametric tests, which are often based on ranks.\nCorrelation coefficients are often presented in the form of a correlation matrix which can display the correlation between a number of variables in a single table (Table 4.2).\n\n\nTable 4.2: Correlation matrix for Height and FVC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight\nFVC\n\n\nHeight\n1\n0.70\nP &lt; 0.0001\n\n\nFVC\n0.70\nP &lt; 0.0001\n1\n\n\n\n\nThis correlation matrix shows that the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between height and lung function is 0.70 with P&lt;0.0001 indicating very strong evidence of a linear association between height and FVC. A correlation matrix sometimes includes correlations between the same variable, indicated as a correlation coefficient of 1. For example, \\(Height\\) is perfectly correlated with itself (i.e. has a correlation coefficient of 1). Similarly, \\(FVC\\) is perfectly correlated with itself.\nCorrelation coefficients are rarely used as important statistics in their own right because they do not fully explain the relationship between the two variables and the range of the data has an important influence on the size of the coefficient. In addition, the statistical significance of the correlation coefficient is often over interpreted because a small correlation which is of no clinical importance can become statistically significant even with a relatively small sample size. For example, a poor correlation of 0.3 will be statistically significant if the sample size is large enough."

Therefore, the regression equation is estimated as:\nFVC (L) = − 18.87 + (0.14 \\(\\times\\) Height in cm)\nThere is very strong evidence of a linear association between FVC and height in cm (P &lt; 0.001).\nThis equation can be used to predict FVC for a person of a given height. For example, the predicted FVC for a person 165 cm tall is estimated as:\nFVC = − 18.87347 + (0.1407567 \\(\\times\\) 165.0) = 4.40 L.\nNote that for the purpose of prediction we have kept all the decimal places in the coefficients to avoid rounding error in the intermediate calculation.\n\n4.6.1 Fit of a linear regression model\nAfter fitting a linear regression model, it is important to know how well the model fits the observed data. One way of assessing the model fit is to compute a statistic called coefficient of determination, denoted by \\(R^2\\). It is the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient \\(r: r^2 = R^2\\). Since the range of \\(r\\) is from −1 to 1, \\(R^2\\) must lie between 0 and 1.\n\\(R^2\\) can be interpreted as the proportion of variability in y that can be explained by variability in x. Hence, the following conditions may arise:\nIf \\(R^2 = 1\\), then all variation in y can be explained by variation of x and all data points fall on the regression line.\nIf \\(R^2 = 0\\), then none of the variation in y is related to x at all, and the variable x explains none of the variability in y.\nIf \\(0 &lt; R^2 &lt;1\\), then the variability of y can be partially explained by the variability in x. The larger the \\(R^2\\) value, the better is the fit of the regression model."

Also, the regression equation describes the relationship between the variables and this is not influenced as much by the spread of the data as the correlation coefficient is.\nThe assumptions that must be met when using linear regression are as follows:\n\nobservations are independent;\nthe relationship between the explanatory and the outcome variable is linear;\nthe residuals are normally distributed.\n\nA residual is defined as the difference between the observed and predicted outcome from the regression model. If the predicted value of the outcome variable is denoted by \\(\\hat y\\) then:\n\\[ \\text{Residual} = \\text{observed} - \\text{predicted} = y - \\hat y\\]\nIt is important for regression modelling that the data are collected in a period when the relationship remains constant. For example, in building a model to predict normal values for lung function the data must be collected when the participants have been resting and not exercising and people taking bronchodilator medications that influence lung capacity should be excluded. In regression, it is not so important that the variables themselves are normally distributed, but it is important that the residuals are. Scatter plots and specific diagnostic tests can be used to check the regression assumptions. Some of these will not be covered in this introductory course but will be discussed in detail in the Regression Methods in Biostatistics course.\nThe distribution of the residuals should always be checked. Large residuals can indicate unusual points or points that may exert undue influence on the estimated regression slope.\nThe histogram of residuals from the model is shown in Figure 4.5. The residuals are approximately normally distributed, with no outlying values.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Histogram of regression residuals"

Other more complex models can be built from this e.g. if we wanted to look at the effect of gender (male vs. female) as binary indicator in the model while adjusting for the effect of height. In that case we would include both the variables in the model as explanatory variables. In the same way we can include any number of explanatory variables (both continuous and categorical) in the model: this is called a multivariable model. Multivariable models are often used for building predictive equations, for example by using age, height, gender and smoking history to predict lung function, or to adjust for confounding and detect effect modification to investigate the association between an exposure and an outcome factor.\nMultiple regression has an important role in investigating causality in epidemiology. The exposure variable under investigation must stay in the model and the effects of other variables which can be confounders or effect-modifiers are tested. The biological, psychological or social meaning of the variables in the model and their interactions are of great importance for interpreting theories of causality.\nOther multivariable models include binary logistic regression for use with a binary outcome variable, or Cox regression for survival analyses. These models, together with multiple regression, will be taught in PHCM9517: Regression Methods in Biostatistics."
