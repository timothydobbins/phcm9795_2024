### Activity 8.1 {-}

To investigate how body weight (kg) effects blood plasma volume (mL), data were collected from 30 participants and a simple linear regression analysis was conducted. The slope of the regression was 68 (95% confidence interval 52 to 84) and the intercept was −1570 (95% confidence interval −2655 to −492).

[*You do not need software for this Activity*]

a) What is the outcome variable and explanatory (exposure) variable? 
b) Interpret the regression slope and its 95% CI
c) Write the regression equation 
d) If we randomly sampled a person from the population and found that their weight is 80kg, what would be the predicted value of plasma volume for this person?  

### Activity 8.2 {-}
To examine whether age predicts IQ, data were collected on 104 people. Use the data in the file `Activity_8.2.csv` to answer the following questions.

a)	What is the outcome variable and the explanatory variable? 
b)	Create a scatter plot with the two variables. What can you infer from the scatter plot? 
c)	Obtain the correlation coefficient between age and IQ and interpret it. 
d)	Conduct a simple linear regression and report the relationship between the two variables including the interpretation of the R^2^ value. Are the assumptions for linear regression met in this model?
e)	What could you infer about the association between age and IQ in the population, based on the results of the regression analysis in this sample? 

### Activity 8.3 {-}
Which of the following correlation coefficients indicates the weakest linear relationship and why?

a) r = 0.72
b) r = 0.41
c) r = 0.13
d) r = −0.33
e) r = −0.84

### Activity 8.4 {-}
Are the following statements true or false?

a) If a correlation coefficient is closer to 1.00 than to 0.00, this indicates that the outcome is caused by the exposure.
b) If a researcher has data on two variables, there will be a higher correlation if the two means are close together and a lower correlation if the two means are far apart.
