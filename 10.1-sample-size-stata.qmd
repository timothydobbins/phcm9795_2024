The **Power, precision and sample size** menu item is located at the very bottom of the **Statistics** menu. **You may need to scroll down the menu to locate the item.**

```{r mod10-menu-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod10", "stata", "mod10-menu-1.png"))
```

The **Power, precision and sample-size** analysis dialog box appears as shown below.

```{r mod10-menu-3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod10", "stata", "mod10-menu-3.png"))
```

## Sample size calculation for two independent samples t-test
To do the problem discussed in Worked Example 10.2, you can expand the **Means** item under **Population parameter** on the left-hand-side of the **Power and sample-size analysis** dialog box, then choose **Two independent** samples. On the right-hand-side of the dialog box, choose **Test comparing two independent means**.

```{r mod10-twomeans-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod10", "stata", "mod10-twomeans-1.png"))
```

The **power twomeans** dialog box will appear. Based on the information in Worked Example 10.2, change **Power** to `0.9` and enter `25` as the **Common standard deviation**. For the means, we can assume that **Control** mean systolic blood pressure is `110` mmHg and the the **Experimental** mean systolic blood pressure is 5 mmHg higher at `115` mmHg. We use equal numbers in each group (allocation ratio of `1` which is the default) because that would give us the smallest total sample size required.

```{r mod10-twomeans-2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod10", "stata", "mod10-twomeans-2.png"))
```

Click **OK** or **Submit** to produce Output 10.1. 

[Command: `power twomeans 110 115, sd(25) power(0.9)`]

## Sample size calculation for paired samples t-test
For a paired sample t-test, go back to the **Power and sample-size analysis** dialog box and click on **Two paired samples** under **Means** on the left-hand-side, then choose **Paired test comparing two correlated means, specify correlation between paired observations** as shown below.
 
```{r mod10-pairedmeans-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod10", "stata", "mod10-pairedmeans-1.png"))
```

In the **power pairedmeans** dialog box, change **Power** to `0.9` and enter `25` as the **Common standard deviation** as shown below. For the means, we can assume that **Control**  mean systolic blood pressure is 110 mmHg and the the **Experimental** mean systolic blood pressure is 5 mmHg higher at `115` mmHg as we had for the independent samples.

```{r mod10-pairedmeans-2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod10", "stata", "mod10-pairedmeans-2.png"))
```
 
Click **OK** or **Submit** to produce Output 10.2. 

[Command: `power pairedmeans 110 115, corr(0) power(0.9) sd(25)`]

## Sample size calculation for difference between two independent proportions

To do the problem discussed in Worked Example 10.3, you can expand the **Proportions** item under **Population parameter** on the left-hand-side of the Power and sample-size analysis dialog box, then choose **Two independent samples**. On the right-hand-side of the dialog box, choose **Chi-squared test comparing two independent proportions**.
 
```{r mod10-twoprop-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod10", "stata", "mod10-twoprop-1.png"))
```
 
The **power twoproportions** dialog box will appear. Based on the information in Worked Example 10.3, check the **Power** is `0.8` and **Significance level** is `0.05` (these are the default values), then enter `0.35` and `0.2` as the **Proportions** as shown below. As with the two independent samples example, we can assume equal numbers in each group (**Allocation ratio** of `1` which is the default).

```{r mod10-twoprop-2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod10", "stata", "mod10-twoprop-2.png"))
```

Click **OK** or **Submit** to obtain Output 10.3.

[Command: `power twoproportions .35 .2, test(chi2)`]

Note: It doesnâ€™t matter if you swap the proportions for the **Control** and **Experimental** group, i.e. the command `power twoproportions .2 .35 , test(chi2)` gives the same results.

If you had difference in proportion, relative risk or odds ratio for the sample size calculation, you can choose them from the drop-down list under Experimental as shown below.

```{r mod10-twoprop-3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod10", "stata", "mod10-twoprop-3.png"))
```
 
## Sample size calculation with relative risk and odds ratio

Using information from Worked Example 10.4, we change **Power** to `0.9`, enter `0.5` as the **Control Proportion**. As we are working with a relative risk, choose **Relative risk** as the effect size, and enter `1.5` as shown below.

```{r mod10-RR-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod10", "stata", "mod10-RR-1.png"))
```

Click **OK** or **Submit** to obtain Output 10.4.

Now we calculate the sample size for Worked Example 10.5. Enter `0.3` as the **Control Proportion**, choose **Odds ratio** as the estimate from the dropdown list and enter `2` as the **Odds ratio.** In this example, you can also try entering two values for **Power**: `0.9` and `0.8` as shown below.

```{r mod10-OR-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod10", "stata", "mod10-OR-1.png"))
```

Click **OK** or **Submit** to obtain the output below. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, highlight=FALSE}
