## Creating a scatter plot

We will demonstrate using Stata for correlation and simple linear regression using the dataset `mod08_lung_function.dta`.

To create a scatter plot to explore the association between height and FVC click: **Graphics > Twoway graph (scatter, line, etc.)**. In the `twoway` dialog box, click **Create...**

```{r twoway-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "twoway-1.png"))
```

A new dialog box will open. Select the **Basic plots** radio button and highlight **Scatter** under **Basic plots: (select type)**. Choose **FVC** for the **Y variable** and **Height** for the **X variable**.

```{r twoway-2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "twoway-2.png"))
```

Click the **Accept** button in the **Plot 1** dialog box to return to the **twoway** dialog box, then click the **OK** or **Submit** button to produce the scatter plot shown in **Figure 8.1**.

[Command: `twoway (scatter FVC Height)`]

To add a fitted line, go back to the `twoway` dialog box. If you clicked the **OK** button, you can go to **Graphics** **> Twoway** **graph (scatter, line, etc.)** to bring it back again.

```{r twoway-3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "twoway-3.png"))
```

Click **Create...**, then select the **Fit plots** radio button and **Linear prediction** under **Fit plots: (select type)**. Choose **FVC** for the **Y variable** and **Height** for the **X variable**.

```{r twoway-4, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "twoway-4.png"))
```

Click the **Accept** button, then the **OK** or **Submit** button to produce the scatterplot below.

[Command: `twoway (scatter FVC Height) (lfit FVC Height)`]

```{r scatter-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "scatter-1.png"))
```

Notice that a legend now appears, and the y-axis title is missing. To add a y-axis title, go to the **Y axis** tab in the **twoway** dialog box to enter your title as shown below.

```{r twoway-5, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "twoway-5.png"))
```

You can click the **Submit** button to check how the scatter plot looks like. Next go the **Legend** tab and select the **Hide legend** radio button.

```{r twoway-6, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "twoway-6.png"))
```

Click the **OK** or **Submit** button when you are finished to produce **Figure 8.3**.

[Command: `twoway (scatter FVC Height) (lfit FVC Height), ytitle(Forced vital capacity (L)) legend(off)`]

To save your graph, go to **File > Save** in the **Graph** window, and be sure to save your file as a PNG file:

```{r twoway-7, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "twoway-7.png"))
```

## Calculating a correlation coefficient

To calculate the Pearson's correlation using the dataset `mod08_lung_function.dta` go to: **Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Summary and descriptive statistics > Pairwise correlations**

Select the two variables, **FVC** and **Height** in the **Variables** box. You can click the **Submit** button to check the output. Next, tick the box for **Print significance level for each entry** to obtain the P-value and the box for **Print number of observations for each entry** to obtain the number of observations used as shown below.

```{r corr-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "corr-1.png"))
```

Click the **OK** or the **Submit** button when you are done to produce **Output 8.1**,

[Command: `pwcorr Height FVC, obs sig`]

## Fitting a simple linear regression model

We will fit a simple linear regression model with `mod08_lung_function.dta` to quantify the relationship between FVC and height.

Choose **Statistics > Linear models and related > Linear regression**

In the `regress` dialog box, select `FVC` as the **Dependent variable**, and `Height` as the **Independent variable**.

```{r regr-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "regr-1.png"))
```

Click the **OK** or the **Submit** button when you are done to produce **Outputs 8.2 and 8.3**.

[Command: `reg FVC Height`]

## Plotting residuals from a simple linear regression

To obtain the residuals, go to **Statistics > Post estimation** after running the regress command.

In the `Postestimation Selector` dialog box, select **Predictions and their SEs, leverage statistics, distance statistics, etc.** in the list under Predictions as shown below.

```{r postest-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "postest-1.png"))
```

In the `predict` dialog box, choose the **Residuals** button and enter a New variable name (e.g. `FVC_resid`) for the residuals from the regression model.

```{r postest-2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "postest-2.png"))
```

Click **OK** button when you are done.

[Command: `predict FVC_resid, residuals`]

You can now check the assumption that the residuals are normally distributed by creating a histogram with the normal curve using **Graphics > Histogram** as shown in **Stata Notes** section for **Module 2**. Below is the **histogram** dialog box used to produce the graph in **Figure 8.5**.

```{r postest-3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "66%",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod08", "stata", "postest-3.png"))
```

[Command: `histogram FVC_resid, bin(12) frequency normal`]
